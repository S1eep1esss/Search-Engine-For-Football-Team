The club competes in La Liga, the top tier of Spanish football.\n\nFounded in 1902 as Madrid Football Club, the club has traditionally worn a white home kit since its inception. The honorific title real is Spanish for \"royal\" and was bestowed to the club by King Alfonso XIII in 1920 together with the royal crown in the emblem. Real Madrid have played their home matches in the 85,000-capacity Santiago Bernab\u00e9u in central Madrid since 1947. Unlike most European sporting entities, Real Madrid's members (socios) have owned and operated the club throughout its history. The official Madrid anthem is the \"Hala Madrid y nada m\u00e1s\", written by RedOne and Manuel Jabois.[8] The club is one of the most widely supported in the world, and is the most followed football club on social media according to the CIES Football Observatory as of 2023[9][10] and was estimated to be worth $6.6 billion in 2024, making it the world's most valuable football club.[11] In 2024, Real Madrid become the first football club to make \u20ac1 billion ($1.08bn) in revenue according to club's announcement in relation to the 2023/24 season.[12]\n\nIn domestic football, the club has won 71 trophies; a record 36 La Liga titles, 20 Copa del Rey, 13 Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a, a Copa Eva Duarte and a Copa de la Liga.[13] In International football, Real Madrid have won a record 33 trophies: a record 15 European Cup/UEFA Champions League titles, a record six UEFA Super Cups, two UEFA Cups, a joint record two Latin Cups, a record one Iberoamerican Cup, and a record eight FIFA Club World championships.[note 1] Madrid was ranked first in the International Federation of Football History & Statistics Club World Ranking for 2000, 2002, 2014, 2017.[17] In UEFA, Madrid ranks first in the all-time club ranking.[18][19]\n\nBeing one of the three founding members of La Liga that have never been relegated from the top division since its inception in 1929 (along with Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona), Real Madrid has many long-standing rivalries, most notably El Cl\u00e1sico with Barcelona and El Derbi Madrile\u00f1o with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. The club established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football during the 1950s and 60s, winning five consecutive and six overall European Cups and reaching a further two finals. This success was replicated on the domestic front, with Madrid winning 12 league titles in 16 years. This team, which included Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano, Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s, Paco Gento and Raymond Kopa is considered, by some in the sport, to be the greatest of all time.[20][21] Real Madrid is known for its Gal\u00e1cticos policy, which involves signing the world's best players, such as Ronaldo, Zinedine Zidane and David Beckham to create a superstar team.[22] The term 'Gal\u00e1cticos policy' generally refers to the two eras of Florentino P\u00e9rez's presidency of the club (2000\u20132006 and 2009\u20132018); however, players brought in just before his tenure are sometimes considered to be part of the Gal\u00e1cticos legacy. A notable example is Steve McManaman, who like many other players also succeeded under the policy.[23] On 26 June 2009, Madrid signed Cristiano Ronaldo for a record-breaking \u00a380 million (\u20ac94 million);[24] he became both the club's and history's all-time top goalscorer.[25][26][27][28] Madrid have recently relaxed the Gal\u00e1cticos policy, instead focusing on signing young talents such as Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior, Rodrygo, Jude Bellingham[29] and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9.[30][31]\n\nReal Madrid is recognised as the greatest football club of the 20th century by FIFA and as the best European club during the same timeframe by the IFFHS,[32] while also receiving the FIFA Centennial Order of Merit in 2004.[33] Real Madrid has the highest participations in the European Cup/Champions League (43),[18] a tournament in which they hold the overall record for the most wins, most draws and most goals scored.[34] Real Madrid is the only club to have won three consecutive titles (three-peat) in the European Cup/Champions League twice, first in 1955\u201356, 1956\u201357, and 1957\u201358, and second in 2015\u201316, 2016\u201317 and 2017\u201318. In June 2024, they won a record-extending 15th Champions League title (the fifth in nine seasons), recognised as such by Guinness World Records.[35] Real Madrid is the first club across all of Europe's top-five leagues to win 100 trophies in all competitions.[36] As of July 2024, Real Madrid are ranked 2nd in the UEFA club rankings and first in last 10 years (2013\u20132023) overall.[37][38]",

It is the third-most valuable football club in the world, worth $5.6 billion, and the world's fourth richest football club in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of \u20ac800.1 million.[3][4] The official Barcelona anthem is the \"Cant del Bar\u00e7a\", written by Jaume Picas and Josep Maria Espin\u00e0s.[5] Barcelona traditionally play in dark shades of blue and garnet stripes, hence nicknamed Blaugrana.\n\nDomestically, Barcelona has won a record 77 trophies: 27 La Liga, 31 Copa del Rey, 14 Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a, three Copa Eva Duarte, and two Copa de la Liga titles, as well as being the record holder for the latter four competitions.

It plays its home matches at the Anoeta Stadium.\n\nReal Sociedad won the Liga title in 1980\u201381 and 1981\u201382, and finished runner-up in 1979\u201380, 1987\u201388, and 2002\u201303. The club has also won the Copa del Rey three times, in 1909, 1987, and 2020. It contests the Basque derby against rivals Athletic Bilbao. Real Sociedad was a founding member of La Liga in 1929; its longest spell in the top flight was for 40 seasons, from 1967 to 2007.[3]\n\nTraditionally the club followed a policy (similar to that of its rival Athletic) of signing only Basque players, before signing Republic of Ireland forward John Aldridge in 1989. While a strong Basque contingent has been retained among its players, nowadays both non-Basque Spaniards and foreign players are represented at the club. Its youth academy subsequent to the all-Basque era has still been very successful in developing internationally renowned players, such as World Cup winners Xabi Alonso and Antoine Griezmann.[4]\n\nThe club has competed in the UEFA Champions League four times. Their first appearance was in the 1981\u201382 edition, where the club lost in the first round against CSKA Sofia. In the following season, the team reached the semifinals, only to lose narrowly against Hamburger SV. In the 2003\u201304 season, the club progressed to the round of 16 before losing to Lyon.

They are known as Los Leones (The Lions) because their stadium was built near a church called San Mam\u00e9s, which was named after Saint Mammes, an early Christian thrown to the lions by the Romans.[5] Mammes pacified the lions and was later made a saint. The team plays its home matches at the San Mam\u00e9s Stadium. Its home colours are red and white-striped shirts with black shorts.\n\nAthletic are the fourth most successful club in La Liga with eight titles to their name. In the table of Copa del Rey titles, Athletic is second only to Barcelona, having won it 24 times.[note 1] It is also the most successful Basque football club in both league and cup titles won. The club also has one of the most successful women's teams in Spain, which has won five championships in the Primera Divisi\u00f3n Femenina.\n\nThe club is one of three founding members of the Primera Divisi\u00f3n that have never been relegated from the top division since its inception in 1929, the others being Real Madrid and Barcelona. These three clubs, along with Osasuna, are the only four professional clubs in Spain that are not sports corporations; instead they are owned and operated by club members. Athletic's main rivals are Real Sociedad, against whom it contests the Basque derby, and Real Madrid, due to sporting and political identity; a minor rivalry also exists with Barcelona due to historical significance. At various points in the club's history, further Basque league derbies have been contested against Alav\u00e9s, Eibar and Osasuna.\n\nThe club is known for its cantera policy of bringing young Basque players through the ranks, as well as recruiting players from other Basque clubs.[6] Athletic's official policy is to sign players native to or trained in football in the greater Basque Country, which includes Biscay, Gipuzkoa, \u00c1lava and Navarre (in Spain), as well as Labourd, Soule and Lower Navarre (in France). Since 1912, Athletic has played exclusively with players meeting its own criteria to be deemed Basque.[7] It has gained Athletic both admirers and critics. The club has been praised for promoting home grown players and club loyalty. The rule does not apply to coaching staff, with several examples of non-Basques both from Spain and abroad having coached the first team.\n\nDespite the implications of the name 'Athletic Club' in English, and unlike some of the other major Spanish teams which have several departments, it is not a multi-sport club, participating only in football, although sections for cycling and other sports existed prior to the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s.[8]",

        "Description": "Manchester City Football Club is a professional football club based in Manchester, England, that competes in the Premier League, the top flight of English football. Founded in 1880 as St. Mark's (West Gorton), they became Ardwick Association Football Club in 1887 and Manchester City in 1894. The club's home ground is the City of Manchester Stadium in east Manchester, to which they moved in 2003, having played at Maine Road since 1923. Manchester City adopted their sky blue home shirts in 1894, the first season with the current name.[4] Over the course of its history, the club has won ten league titles, seven FA Cups, eight League Cups, seven FA Community Shields, one UEFA Champions League, one European Cup Winners' Cup, one UEFA Super Cup and one FIFA Club World Cup.\n\nThe club joined the Football League in 1892, and won their first major honour, the FA Cup, in 1904. Manchester City had its first major period of success in the late 1960s and early 1970s, winning the league title, FA Cup, League Cup, and European Cup Winners Cup under the management of Joe Mercer and Malcolm Allison. After losing the 1981 FA Cup final, Manchester City went through a period of decline, culminating in relegation to the third tier of English football for the only time in their history in 1998. They since regained promotion to the top tier in 2001\u201302 and have remained a fixture in the Premier League since 2002\u201303.\n\nManchester City received considerable financial investment both in playing staff and facilities following its takeover by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan through the Abu Dhabi United Group in August 2008.[5] This started a new era of unprecedented success, with the club winning the FA Cup in 2011 and the Premier League in 2012, both their first since the 1960s, followed by another league title in 2014. Under the management of Pep Guardiola, Manchester City won the Premier League in 2018, becoming the only team in the competition history to attain 100 points in a single season. In 2018\u201319, they won four trophies, completing an unprecedented sweep of all domestic titles in England and becoming the first English men's team to win the domestic treble.[6] This was followed by four consecutive Premier League titles in 2020\u201321, 2021\u201322, 2022\u201323 and 2023\u201324, as well as the club's first Champions League final in 2021, which they lost to Chelsea. The 2022\u201323 season saw Manchester City win their maiden European Cup and complete the continental treble in the process, becoming the second English club to do so.[7] The club is ranked first in the UEFA coefficient standings as of 2023.[8]\n\nManchester City topped the Deloitte Football Money League at the end of the 2021\u201322 season, making it the football club with the highest revenue in the world, approximated at \u20ac731 million.[9] In 2022, Forbes estimated the club was the sixth-most valuable in the world, worth $4.250 billion.[10][11] Manchester City are owned by City Football Group Limited, a British-based holding company valued at \u00a33.73 ($4.8) billion in November 2019 and majority-owned by the Abu Dhabi United Group.[12][13]",

In domestic football, Arsenal have won 13 league titles (including one unbeaten title), a record 14 FA Cups, two League Cups, 17 FA Community Shields, and a Football League Centenary Trophy. In European football, they have one European Cup Winners' Cup and one Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. In terms of trophies won, it is the third-most successful club in English football.[2]\n\nArsenal were the first club from southern England to join the Football League in 1893, and it reached the First Division in 1904. Relegated only once, in 1913, it continues the longest streak in the top division,[3] and has won the second-most top-flight matches in English football history.[4] In the 1930s, Arsenal won five League Championships and two FA Cups, and another FA Cup and two Championships after the war. In 1970\u201371, it won its first League and FA Cup double. Between 1989 and 2005, they won five league titles and five FA Cups, including two more doubles. They completed the 20th century with the highest average league position.[5] Between 1998 and 2017, Arsenal qualified for the UEFA Champions League for an English football record nineteen consecutive seasons.[6] The streak ended in 2017, when Arsenal finished in fifth place, one point away from the fourth spot occupied by Liverpool.[6]\n\nIn 1886, munitions workers at the Royal Arsenal in Woolwich founded the club as Dial Square. In 1913, the club crossed the city to Arsenal Stadium in Highbury, becoming close neighbours of Tottenham Hotspur, and creating the North London derby. Herbert Chapman won the club its first silverware, and his legacy enabled a trophy-laden period in the 1930s. He helped introduce the WM formation, floodlights, and shirt numbers;[7] he also added the white sleeves and brighter red to the club's jersey.[8] Ars\u00e8ne Wenger is the club's longest-serving manager and has won the most trophies. He won a record seven FA Cups, and his third and final title-winning team set an English record for the longest top-flight unbeaten league run at 49 games between 2003 and 2004, receiving the nickname The Invincibles.\n\nIn 2006, the club moved to the nearby Emirates Stadium. With an annual revenue of \u00a3367.1m in the 2021\u201322 season,[9] Arsenal was estimated to be worth US$2.26 billion by Forbes, making it the world's tenth-most valuable football club,[10] while it is one of the most followed on social media.[11] The motto of the club is Victoria Concordia Crescit, Latin for \"Victory Through Harmony\".",

In international competitions, the club has won six European Cups, three UEFA Cups, four UEFA Super Cups\u2014all English records\u2014and one FIFA Club World Cup. Liverpool established itself as a major force in domestic football in the 1960s under Bill Shankly, before becoming perennial title challengers at home and abroad under Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan and Kenny Dalglish who led the club to a combined eleven league titles and four European Cups through the 1970s and 80s. Liverpool won two further European Cups in 2005 and 2019 under the management of Rafael Ben\u00edtez and J\u00fcrgen Klopp, respectively; the latter led Liverpool to a 19th league title in 2020, the club's first during the Premier League era.\n\nAlready nicknamed \"The Reds\", it was under Shankly in the 60s that the team first adopted the distinctive all-red home strip which has been used ever since. Also adopted under Shankly's tenure was the club's anthem \"You'll Never Walk Alone\". The Reds compete in the local Merseyside derby against fellow Liverpool club Everton, often referred to simply as \"The Blues\".

The Heysel Stadium disaster, where escaping fans were pressed against a collapsing wall at the 1985 European Cup Final in Brussels, resulted in 39 deaths, most of which were Italians and Juventus fans. Liverpool were given a six-year ban from European competitions, and all other English clubs received a five-year ban. The Hillsborough disaster in 1989, where 97 Liverpool supporters died in a crowd crush against perimeter fencing, led to the elimination of fenced standing terraces in favour of all-seater stadiums in the top two tiers of English football. Prolonged campaigning for justice saw further coroner's inquests, commissions and independent panels that ultimately exonerated the fans.",

Eight players were killed in the Munich air disaster, but Busby rebuilt the team around star players George Best, Denis Law and Bobby Charlton \u2013 known as the United Trinity. They won two more league titles before becoming the first English club to win the European Cup in 1968.\n\nAfter Busby's retirement, Manchester United were unable to produce sustained success until the arrival of Alex Ferguson, who became the club's longest-serving and most successful manager, winning 38 trophies including 13 league titles, five FA Cups and two Champions League titles between 1986 and 2013.[8] In the 1998\u201399 season, under Ferguson, the club became the first in the history of English football to achieve the continental treble of the Premier League, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League.[9] In winning the UEFA Europa League under Jos\u00e9 Mourinho in 2016\u201317, they became one of five clubs to have won the original three main UEFA club competitions (the Champions League, Europa League and Cup Winners' Cup).\n\nManchester United are one of the most widely supported football clubs in the world[10][11] and have rivalries with Liverpool, Manchester City, Arsenal and Leeds United.

The club, founded in 1874, compete in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. The team have played at their home ground, Villa Park, since 1897. Aston Villa are one of the oldest and most successful clubs in England, having won the Football League First Division seven times, the FA Cup seven times, the League Cup five times, and the European Cup and European Super Cup once.\n\nAston Villa has been a leading English club since the 1880s, when they were pioneers of the modern passing game. This short, quick combination passing style was introduced by Scotsman George Ramsay, who was appointed as the world's first professional football manager in 1886. The club was influential in the sport's move to professionalism in 1885, and it was a Villa director, William McGregor, who founded the world's first Football League in 1888.[3][4][5][6]\n\nGeorge Ramsay's trophy haul of six League Championships and six FA Cups established Aston Villa as the most successful club in England, a position it held from the 1890s until the 1970s. Villa scored 128 goals in season 1930\u201331, which remains the all-time top-flight record,[7] however the club began its first decline in the mid-1930s; the 1940s and 1950s were generally a period of mediocrity followed by a steep decline in the 1960s which culminated in a takeover of the club by Doug Ellis in 1968 and Villa's first and only relegation to the third tier of English football in 1969\u201370. Villa returned to the elite from the mid-1970s under manager Ron Saunders, who led the club to a seventh top-flight league title in 1980\u201381. They became only the fourth English club to win the European Cup, in 1981\u201382, followed by the European Super Cup in 1982.\n\nAston Villa were a founding member of the Premier League in 1992, one of just three clubs to have been a founding member of both the Football League and the Premier League. The club regularly qualified for European football in the 1990s, but following a period in which the club struggled to compete with the high levels of spending of the leading clubs, Doug Ellis sold his stake in the club to American billionaire Randy Lerner, whose ownership of the club ended with Villa's first and only relegation from the Premier League in season 2015\u201316. The club returned to the Premier League in 2019.\n\nDuring their history Villa has spent 111 seasons in the top-flight, the second highest of any club, and provided 77 England internationals, also the second highest of any club.

The club's traditional kit colours are claret shirts with sky blue sleeves, white shorts and sky blue socks. Their traditional club badge is of a rampant lion.[10][11] The club is currently owned by V Sports, a company owned by the Egyptian billionaire Nassef Sawiris, the American billionaire Wes Edens, and American investment company Atairos.",

The club competes in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. The club plays at the London Stadium, having moved from their former home, the Boleyn Ground, in 2016.\n\nWest Ham United was founded in 1895 as Thames Ironworks and reformed in 1900 as West Ham United. It moved to the Boleyn Ground, which remained its home ground for more than a century, in 1904. The team initially competed in the Southern League and Western League before joining the Football League in 1919. It was promoted to the top flight in 1923, when it was also losing finalist in the first FA Cup final held at Wembley. In 1940, the club won the inaugural Football League War Cup.\n\nWest Ham United has won five major honours in its history. Domestically, it has been winner of the FA Cup three times (1964, 1975 and 1980) and runner-up twice (1923 and 2006). In European competitions, the club has reached three major European finals winning the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1965, finishing runner-up in the same competitions in 1976, and winning the second edition of the Europa Conference League in 2023. The club has also won one minor European trophy by winning the Intertoto Cup in 1999. West Ham United is one of eight clubs never to have fallen below the second tier of English football, spending 66 of 98 league seasons in the top flight, up to and including the 2023\u201324 season. The club's highest league position to date came in 1985\u201386, when it achieved third place in the then First Division.\n\nThree West Ham players were members of the 1966 World Cup finals-winning England team: captain Bobby Moore and goalscorers Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters. The club has a long-standing rivalry with Millwall, and the fixture has gained notoriety for frequent incidents of football hooliganism. West Ham adopted their claret and sky blue colour scheme in the early 1900s, with the most common iteration of a claret shirt and sky blue sleeves first emerging in 1904.[4]",

The club competes in the Premier League, the top tier of English football.\n\nAlthough formally created as a professional outfit in 1905 at the Crystal Palace Exhibition building, the club's origins can be traced as far back as 1861.[3][4] The club used the FA Cup final stadium situated inside the grounds of the Palace for their home games between 1905 and 1915, when they were forced to leave due to the outbreak of the First World War. In 1924, they moved to their current home at Selhurst Park.\n\nPalace spent their early years as a professional club playing in the Southern League, winning various regional titles. They were elected to the Football League in 1920, and have overall mainly competed in the top two tiers of English football during their league history. Since 1964, Palace have only dropped below the second tier once for three seasons between 1974 and 1977. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Palace became a force in the top flight and challenged Arsenal and Liverpool for the English league title in 1990\u201391, but eventually ended the season in third place, the club's highest league finish to date. Palace only missed out on qualification for the UEFA Cup at the end of that season due to the limited number of European places available to English clubs after the lifting of the UEFA ban caused by the Heysel Stadium disaster. It was also around this time that Palace reached the FA Cup final in 1990, narrowly losing to Manchester United after a replay, and they became founder members of the Premier League.\n\nFollowing their relegation from the Premier League in 1998, Palace went into decline after suffering financial problems which resulted in the club going into administration twice. But Palace recovered and were promoted back to the Premier League in 2013, where they have remained ever since and reached another FA Cup final in 2016, again finishing runners-up to Manchester United. The club are currently on their longest continuous run in the top flight, achieving twelve consecutive seasons at the start of the 2024\u201325 campaign.\n\nThe club's kit colours were claret and blue until 1973, when they changed to the red and blue vertical stripes worn today. Palace have a long-standing and fierce rivalry with Brighton & Hove Albion,[5] and also share strong rivalries with local clubs Millwall and Charlton Athletic.",

The club competes in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. The club has played at Molineux Stadium since moving from Dudley Road in 1889. The club's traditional kit consists of old gold shirts and socks with black shorts. Since 1979, the kit has also featured the club's \"wolf's head\" logo. Long-standing rivalries exist with other clubs from the West Midlands, including Aston Villa, and Birmingham City but the main one being the Black Country derby contested with West Bromwich Albion. Since 2016, the club has been owned by the Chinese conglomerate Fosun International.\n\nFormed as St. Luke's F.C. in 1877, the club changed name to Wolverhampton Wanderers two years later and became one of the founding members of the Football League in 1888. They won the FA Cup for the first time in 1893, and again as a Second Division team in 1908 following the club's relegation two years previously. They fell to the third tier in 1923, but went on to win the Third Division North in 1923\u201324 and the Second Division in 1931\u201332.

Wolves won the League Cup in 1974 and 1980, and again won the Second Division title in 1976\u201377.\n\nWolves suffered a financial crisis during the early-1980s recession that led to the club coming close to liquidation in 1982. In the five seasons between 1981\u201382 and 1985\u201386 Wolves were relegated four times (although there was also one promotion in 1982\u201383), meaning the club ended up in what was then the Football League Fourth Division (now EFL League Two) for the first (and so far only) time in the club's history. However, the club immediately started a swift turn-around, and having been beaten in the inaugural Football League play-off final in 1987, Wolves won the Fourth Division and Football League Trophy titles in 1987\u201388, followed by the Third Division title in 1988\u201389.\n\nAfter fourteen seasons in the second tier between 1989 and 2003, Wolves reached the Premier League, founded in 1992, for the first time with victory in the 2003 play-offs, though they were relegated after a single season in the top division on this occasion. Wolves won the Championship in 2008\u201309 to return to the Premier League, but endured relegation in 2011\u201312, followed by relegation again (to EFL League One) in 2012\u201313. The club then returned to the Premier League after first winning the League One title in 2013\u201314, followed by another Championship title in 2017\u201318.\n\nAfter becoming one of the first British clubs to install floodlights at its home ground in 1953, Wolves arranged televised \"floodlit friendlies\" against leading overseas club sides between 1953 and 1956, which were instrumental in the launch of the European Cup (now known as the UEFA Champions League) in 1955. Wolves reached the quarter-finals of the competition in 1959\u201360 as well as the semi-finals of the 1960\u201361 European Cup Winners' Cup and the inaugural UEFA Cup Final in 1972. Following a 39-year absence from UEFA competitions, they reached the UEFA Europa League quarter-finals in 2020.",

They are most known for their men's professional football team, who play in the Bundesliga, the top tier of the German football league system. Bayern are the most successful club in German football, having won a record 33 national titles, including eleven consecutive titles from 2013 to 2023 and a record 20 national cups, alongside numerous European titles.\n\nBayern Munich was founded in 1900 by eleven players, led by Franz John.[4] Although Bayern won its first national championship in 1932, the club was not selected for the Bundesliga during its inception in 1963.

Overall, Bayern have won six European Cup/UEFA Champions League titles (a German record), winning their sixth title in the 2020 final as part of the Treble, and it became the second European club to achieve this feat twice. Bayern has also won one UEFA Cup, one European Cup Winners' Cup, two UEFA Super Cups, two FIFA Club World Cups and two Intercontinental Cups, making it one of the most successful European clubs internationally, and the only German club to have won both international titles. Bayern players have accumulated five Ballon d'Or awards, two The Best FIFA Men's Player awards, five European Golden Shoe and three UEFA Men's Player of the Year awards, including UEFA Club Footballer of the Year.\n\nBy winning the 2020 FIFA Club World Cup, Bayern Munich became only the second club to win the \"sextuple\" (winning the League, Cup, and Champions League in one season followed by the Domestic Supercup, UEFA Supercup and Club World Cup in the next season), or all trophies that a club can win in a calendar year. Bayern Munich are one of five clubs to have won all three of UEFA's main club competitions and the only German club to achieve that.

        "Description": "RasenBallsport Leipzig e.V. (lit.\u2009'Lawn Ball Sports Leipzig'), commonly known as RB Leipzig, is a German professional football club based in Leipzig, Saxony. The club was founded in 2009 by the initiative of the company Red Bull GmbH, which purchased the playing rights of fifth-tier side SSV Markranst\u00e4dt with the intent of advancing the new club to the top-flight Bundesliga within eight years. The men's professional football club is run by the spin-off organization RasenBallsport Leipzig GmbH.[3] RB Leipzig plays its home matches at the Red Bull Arena. The club nickname is Die Roten Bullen (German for 'The Red Bulls').[4][5]\n\nIn its inaugural season in 2009\u201310, RB dominated the NOFV-Oberliga S\u00fcd (V) and was promoted as champions to the Regionalliga Nord (IV). RB Leipzig won the 2012\u201313 Regionalliga Nordost season without a single defeat and was promoted to the 3. Liga (III), then finished the 2013\u201314 3. Liga season as runners-up and was promoted to the 2. Bundesliga (II) as the first team since the introduction of the 3. Liga to win promotion after only one season. On 12 May 2016, RB Leipzig along with SC Freiburg ensured promotion to the Bundesliga for the 2016\u201317 season with a 2\u20130 win over Karlsruher SC.[6]\n\nRB Leipzig earned a place in the UEFA Champions League for the first time by finishing as runners-up in the 2016\u201317 Bundesliga.[7] They reached the semi-finals of the 2019\u201320 UEFA Champions League, losing to Paris Saint-Germain of France. On 21 May 2022, they won their first major title, the DFB-Pokal, against SC Freiburg. They would win a second consecutive title the following season, this time defeating Eintracht Frankfurt.\n\nRB Leipzig's entrance into the upper echelons of German football has proven controversial, as the club's heavy corporate influence is regarded by many Germans to be antithetical to the traditional ownership, structure and management of sports clubs in Germany.[8] On the other hand, some have expressed appreciation for what they view as an honourable endeavour to establish a durable footprint for the Bundesliga in the former German Democratic Republic, which previously had been at best tenuous since German reunification.[9]\n\nHistory\n2006\u20132009: negotiations with various clubs and founding\nBefore investing in Leipzig, Red Bull GmbH, led by co-owner Dietrich Mateschitz, spent three and a half years looking for a suitable location to invest in German football.[10] Besides Leipzig, the company also considered a location in Western Germany, exploring such cities as Hamburg, Munich and D\u00fcsseldorf.[11]\n\nThe company made its first attempt to enter the German football scene in 2006. On the advice of Franz Beckenbauer, a personal friend of Dietrich Mateschitz, the company decided to invest in Leipzig.[12][13][14][15][16] The local football club FC Sachsen Leipzig, successor to the former East German champions BSG Chemie Leipzig, had for years been in financial difficulties.[17][18] Red Bull GmbH drew up plans to invest up to 50 million euros in the club. The company planned a takeover, with a change of the team's colours and club name. Involved in the arrangements was film entrepreneur Michael K\u00f6lmel, sponsor of FC Sachsen Leipzig and owner of the Zentralstadion.[17][19] By 2006, FC Sachsen Leipzig played in the Oberliga, by then the fourth tier in the German football league system. Playing in the fourth tier, the club had to undergo the German Football Association (DFB) licensing procedure. Red Bull GmbH and the club were close to a deal, but the plans were vetoed by the DFB, which rejected the proposed new club name \"FC Red Bull Sachsen Leipzig\" fearing too much influence from the company.[17][20][21] After months of fan protests against Red Bull's involvement, which deteriorated into violence, the company officially abandoned the plans.[22]\n\nRed Bull GmbH then turned to the former West Germany. The company made contact with Hamburg-based cult club FC St. Pauli, known for its left-leaning supporters, and met representatives of the club to discuss a sponsorship deal. A short time before, supporters of FC St. Pauli had participated in protests against Red Bull's takeover of SV Austria Salzburg. Once it became clear to the Hamburg side that the company had plans that went far beyond conventional sponsoring, it immediately ended the contact, and the question was never considered by the club's management.[11] Red Bull then made contact with TSV 1860 Munich. Negotiations began behind closed doors, but the club was not interested in an investment and ended the discussions.[23][24]\n\nIn 2007, Red Bull GmbH made plans to invest in Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf, a traditional club with more than 100 years of history.[25] The plans became public, and it was revealed[by whom?] that the company wanted to acquire more than 50 percent of the shares. Rumours spread that the company wanted to rename the club \"Red Bull D\u00fcsseldorf\", or similar. This was immediately met with wild[vague] protests from club supporters.[11] As with FC Sachsen Leipzig, Red Bull's offer also ran into legal difficulties: the statutes of the DFB did not allow changing a club name for advertising purposes, nor for an external investor to obtain a majority share.[25][26][27] Eventually, the plans were soundly rejected by club members.[11][24] The company began to reconsider the former East Germany.[11]\n\nLeipzig was considered[by whom?] an ideal place for an investment. The potential for establishing a new club in Leipzig seemed huge.[according to whom?] The city had a rich history in football, being the meeting place for the founding of the DFB and the home of the first German national football champions, VfB Leipzig.[10] During East Germany's existence, local teams such as 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig and its rival, BSG Chemie Leipzig, played at the highest level of the East German football league system, and even on the international level. The current state of football there was, however, poor. No team from the city had played in the Bundesliga since 1994,[28] and no team had played in a professional league since 1998.[11] Its two best teams would soon play in the Oberliga, and local football was plagued by fan violence.[10] The city hungered for top-level football.[29][30] Leipzig had a population of around 500,000 inhabitants. The city thus had considerable economic strength and fan potential.[according to whom?] At the same time, there were no Bundesliga clubs located anywhere near the city, which further strengthened the possibility[according to whom?] of attracting sponsors and fans.\n\nLeipzig was fortunate to have a well-developed infrastructure, in the form of an international airport, motorway connections and, most importantly,[according to whom?] a large, modern football stadium.[31][32] The Zentralstadion was a former 2006 FIFA World Cup venue and the second-largest football stadium in the east of Germany, after the Olympiastadion in Berlin.[33]\n\nAn investment in a club playing in one of the top divisions in Germany would have been a costly affair for Red Bull. From previous experience, the company knew that the existing traditions of such a club would hinder success in the league.[34] It also knew that an investment in a club playing in one of the top divisions would meet legal difficulties,[vague] making such an investment risky.[35][36] Instead, the company found that a newly established club, designed for the company, would be the better option for an investment.[24][31] Early in 2009, Red Bull GmbH contacted the Saxony Football Association (SFV), about the procedure to establish a new club in Saxony.[22]",

It is best known for its men's professional football team, which plays in the Bundesliga, the top tier of the German football league system. The club have won eight league championships, five DFB-Pokals, one UEFA Champions League, one Intercontinental Cup, and one UEFA Cup Winners' Cup.\n\nFounded in 1909 by eighteen football players from Dortmund, the football team is part of a large membership-based sports club with more than 189,000 members in 2023,[6] making Borussia Dortmund the fifth largest sports club by membership in the world. The club also has a women's handball team. Since 1974, Dortmund have played their home games at the Westfalenstadion; the stadium is the largest in Germany, and Dortmund has the highest average attendance of any association football club in the world.[7]\n\nBorussia Dortmund's colours are black and yellow, giving the club its nickname die Schwarzgelben.[8][9] They hold a long-standing rivalry with Ruhr neighbours Schalke 04, against whom they contest the Revierderby. They also contest Der Klassiker with Bayern Munich.\n\nUnder the directorship of Michael Zorc in the 2010s, Dortmund cultivated a reputation for spotting and developing young talent, and have remained focused on developing a youth system.[10] As of 2024, Dortmund had the second most revenue across football clubs in Germany, and the 12th most revenue across all football teams in the world, per Deloitte's Football Money League.[11]\n\nHistory\nFoundation and early years\n\nBorussia Dortmund in 1913\nThe club was founded on 19 December 1909 by a group of young men unhappy with the Catholic church-sponsored Trinity Youth, where they played football under the stern and unsympathetic eye[tone] of the local parish priest. The priest, Father Dewald was blocked at the door when he tried to break up the organising meeting being held in a room of the local pub, Zum Wildsch\u00fctz. The founders were Franz and Paul Braun, Henry Cleve, Hans Debest, Paul Dziendzielle, Franz, Julius and Wilhelm Jacobi, Hans Kahn, Gustav M\u00fcller, Franz Risse, Fritz Schulte, Hans Siebold, August T\u00f6nnesmann, Heinrich and Robert Unger, Fritz Weber and Franz Wendt. The name Borussia is Latin for Prussia but was taken from Borussia beer from the nearby Borussia brewery in Dortmund.[12] The team began playing in blue and white striped shirts with a red sash, and black shorts. In 1913, they donned the black and yellow stripes for the first time.[13]\n\nOver the next decades the club had only modest success playing in local leagues. They had a brush[tone] with bankruptcy in 1929 when an attempt to boost the club's fortunes by signing some paid professional footballers failed miserably and left the team deep in debt. They survived only through the generosity of a local supporter who covered the team's shortfall out of his own pocket.\n\nThe 1930s saw the rise of the Third Reich, which restructured sports and football organisations throughout the nation to suit the regime's goals. Borussia's president was replaced when he refused to join the Nazi Party, and a couple of members who surreptitiously used the club's offices to produce anti-Nazi pamphlets were executed in the last days of the war. The club did have greater success in the newly established Gauliga Westfalen, but would have to wait until after the Second World War to make a breakthrough. It was during this time that Borussia developed its intense rivalry with Schalke 04 of suburban Gelsenkirchen, the most successful side of the era (see Revierderby). Like every other organisation in Germany, Borussia was dissolved by the Allied occupation authorities after the war in an attempt to distance the country's institutions from its recent Nazi past. There was a short-lived attempt to merge the club with two others \u2013 Werksportgemeinschaft Hoesch and Freier Sportverein 98 \u2013 as Sportgemeinschaft Borussia von 1898, but it was as Ballspiel-Verein Borussia (BVB) that they made their first appearance in the national league final in 1949, where they lost 2\u20133 to VfR Mannheim.[citation needed]",

Each of these clubs was made up of school pupils with middle-class roots[4] who learned new sports such as rugby union and football from English expatriates such as William Cail who introduced rugby in 1865.[5]\n\nStuttgarter Fu\u00dfballverein was founded at the Zum Becher hotel in Stuttgart on 9 September 1893.[6] FV were initially a rugby club, playing games at St\u00f6ckach-Eisbahn before moving to Cannstatter Wasen in 1894. The rugby club established a football section in 1908. The team drew players primarily from local schools, under the direction of teacher Carl Kaufmann, and quickly achieved its first success; in 1909, they were runners-up to FSV 1897 Hannover in the national rugby final, losing 6\u20133.[7] Rugby was soon replaced by association football within the club, as spectators found the game too complicated to follow.\n\nIn 1909, FV joined the S\u00fcddeutschen Fu\u00dfballverband (South German Football Association),[8] playing in the second tier B-Klasse. In their second season FV won a district final against future merger partner Kronen-Klub Cannstatt before being defeated by FV Zuffenhausen in the county championship that would have seen the side promoted. They eventually advanced to the senior S\u00fcdkreis-Liga in 1912.",

It is best known for its football club, which was founded on 8 March 1899. The club currently plays in the Bundesliga, the top tier of the German football league system. Eintracht have won the German championship once, the DFB-Pokal five times, the UEFA Europa League twice and finished as runner-up in the European Cup once. The team was one of the founding members of the Bundesliga at its inception[4] and has spent a total of 55 seasons in the top division, thus making them the seventh longest participating club in the highest tier of the league.\n\nSince 1925 their stadium has been the Waldstadion, which is currently named Deutsche Bank Park for sponsorship reasons.[5]\n\nEintracht Frankfurt have either won or drawn more than three-quarters of their games as well as having finished the majority of their seasons placed in the top half of the table,[6] but also having the highest number of losses in the league (657).[7] With an average attendance of 47,942 since 2013[8] the team also has one of the highest attendance ratings in the world and the eighth highest out of the 36 Bundesliga and 2. Bundesliga teams. The player with the highest number of appearances (602) in the Bundesliga, Charly K\u00f6rbel,[9] spent his entire senior career as a defender for Eintracht Frankfurt. The club's primary rival is local club Kickers Offenbach, although, due to spending most of their history in different divisions, the two have only played two league matches within the last 40 years.[when?][10]\n\nWith almost 14,000 active athletes in over 50 sports in 2024, Eintracht Frankfurt is the largest multi-sports club in the world with a professional football team.[11]\n\nHistory\nSee also: List of Eintracht Frankfurt seasons\nClub origins\n\nThe first team of Frankfurter Fu\u00dfball-Club Victoria in 1899\nThe origins of the club go back to a pair of football clubs founded in 1899: Frankfurter Fu\u00dfball-Club Victoria von 1899 \u2013 regarded[by whom?] as the original team in the club's history \u2013 and Frankfurter Fu\u00dfball-Club Kickers von 1899.[citation needed] Both clubs were founding members of the new Nordkreis-Liga in 1909.[citation needed] These two teams merged in May 1911 to become Frankfurter Fu\u00dfball Verein (Kickers-Victoria), an instant success,[tone] taking three league titles from 1912 to 1914 in the Nordkreis-Liga and qualifying for the Southern German championship in each of those seasons.[citation needed] In turn, Frankfurter FV joined the gymnastics club Frankfurter Turngemeinde von 1861 to form TuS Eintracht Frankfurt von 1861 in 1920.[citation needed] The German word Eintracht means 'harmony' or 'concord', and so Eintracht is the equivalent of United in English in the names of sports teams.[12]\n\n\nOberliga S\u00fcd match in 1946: Karlsruher FV v Eintracht Frankfurt\nAt the time, sports in Germany was dominated by nationalistic gymnastics organizations, and under pressure from that sport's governing authority, the gymnasts and footballers went their separate ways again in 1927, as Turngemeinde Eintracht Frankfurt von 1861 and Sportgemeinde Eintracht Frankfurt (FFV) von 1899.\n\n\nHistorical chart of Eintracht Frankfurt league performance\nThrough the late 1920s and into the 1930s, Eintracht won a handful of[quantify] local and regional championships, first in the Kreisliga Nordmain, then in the Bezirksliga Main and Bezirksliga Main-Hessen. After being eliminated from the national level playoffs after quarterfinal losses in 1930 and 1931, they won their way to the final in 1932 where they were beaten 2\u20130 by Bayern Munich, who claimed their first ever German championship. In 1933, German football was re-organized into sixteen Gauligen under the Third Reich, and the club played first division football in the Gauliga S\u00fcdwest, consistently finishing in the upper half of the table and winning their division in 1938.\n\nEintracht picked up where they left off[tone] after World War II, joining the new first division Oberliga S\u00fcd. In 1946, Eintracht won the first Hessenpokal, and finished third in the Oberliga S\u00fcd a year later. In 1953, they would win the Oberliga S\u00fcd title, qualifying Eintracht for the German championship, though they did not make it to the final.",

It plays in the Bundesliga, having been promoted as champions from the 2. Bundesliga in 2016. Between 1954 and 2021, Freiburg's stadium was the Dreisamstadion. The club moved to the newly built Europa-Park Stadion in 2021. Volker Finke, who was the club's manager between 1991 and 2007, was the longest-serving manager in the history of professional football in Germany until 2023, when Frank Schmidt completed 16 years as coach of Heidenheim and became the longest-serving coach in the history of professional football in Germany. Joachim L\u00f6w, former manager of the Germany national team, is the club's second-highest all-time leading goal scorer, with 81 goals in 252 games during his three spells at the club,[2] behind Nils Petersen.\n\nHistory\nEarly history\nThe club traces its origins to a pair of clubs founded in 1904: Freiburger Fu\u00dfballverein 04 was organised in March of that year; FC Schwalbe Freiburg just two months later.[citation needed] Both clubs underwent name changes, with Schwalbe becoming FC Mars in 1905, Mars becoming Union Freiburg in 1906, and FV 04 Freiburg becoming Sportverein Freiburg 04 in 1909.[citation needed] Three years later, SV and Union formed Sportclub Freiburg, at the same time incorporating the griffin head.\n\nIn 1918, after World War I, SC Freiburg entered a temporary arrangement with Freiburger FC to be able to field a full side called KSG Freiburg.[citation needed] The next year, SC Freiburg associated themselves with FT 1844 Freiburg as that club's football department, until 1928 when they left to enter into a stadium-sharing arrangement with PSV (Polizeisportverein) Freiburg 1924 that lasted until 1930 and the failure of PSV.[citation needed] SC Freiburg then started again with FT 1844 Freiburg in 1938. The club played first in the Bezirksliga Baden in 1928, then in the Gauliga Baden, from which they were relegated in 1934.\n\nAt the end of World War II, Allied occupation authorities disbanded most existing organizations in Germany, including football and sports clubs. The clubs reconstituted themselves after about a year, but were required to take on new names in an attempt to disassociate them from Nazis. SC Freiburg was therefore briefly known as VfL Freiburg. By 1950, French-occupation authorities allowed the clubs to reclaim their old identities. Finally, in 1952, SC Freiburg left FT Freiburg behind again.",

A fifth division side in 2000, the club rapidly advanced through the German football league system with the financial backing of alumnus and software mogul Dietmar Hopp, and in 2008 Hoffenheim was promoted to the top tier Bundesliga. In the 2017\u201318 season, Hoffenheim finished third in the Bundesliga (its best to date), qualifying for the UEFA Champions League group stage for the first time.\n\nSince 2009, Hoffenheim has played its home games at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena (known as PreZero Arena for sponsorship reasons), having previously played at the Dietmar-Hopp-Stadion from 1999.\n\nHistory\nThe modern-day club was formed in 1945, when gymnastics club Turnverein Hoffenheim (founded 1 July 1899) and football club Fu\u00dfballverein Hoffenheim (founded 1921) merged. At the beginning of the 1990s, the club was a local amateur side playing in the eighth division Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg A-Liga.[citation needed] They steadily improved and by 1996 were competing in the Verbandsliga Nordbaden (V).\n\nAround 2000,[vague][when?] alumnus Dietmar Hopp returned to the club of his youth as a financial backer.[citation needed] Hopp was the co-founder of software firm SAP and he put some of his money into the club. His contributions generated almost immediate results:[according to whom?][original research?] in 2000 Hoffenheim finished first in the Verbandsliga and was promoted to the fourth-tier Oberliga Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg.[citation needed] Another first-place finish moved the club up to the Regionalliga S\u00fcd (III) for the 2001\u201302 season.[citation needed] They finished 13th in their first season in the Regionalliga, but improved significantly the next year, earning a fifth-place result.\n\nHoffenheim earned fifth and seventh-place finishes in the next two seasons, before improving to fourth in 2005\u201306 to earn their best result to date. The club made its first DFB-Pokal appearance in the 2003\u201304 competition and performed well,[according to whom?] advancing to the quarter-finals by eliminating 2. Bundesliga sides Eintracht Trier and Karlsruher SC and Bundesliga club Bayer Leverkusen before being put out themselves by another 2. Bundesliga side, VfB L\u00fcbeck.\n\nNegotiations to merge TSG Hoffenheim, Astoria Walldorf, and SV Sandhausen to create FC Heidelberg 06 in 2005 were abandoned due to the resistance of the latter two clubs, and the failure to agree on whether the new side's stadium should be located in Heidelberg or Eppelheim.[citation needed] Team owner Hopp clearly [according to whom?] preferred Heidelberg, but could not overcome the resistance of local firm Wild, which had already reserved the site of the planned stadium for its new production facilities.",

The team joined the Bundesliga in 1965 and saw the majority of its success in the 1970s, where, under the guidance of Hennes Weisweiler and then Udo Lattek, a young squad with a fast, aggressive playing style was formed.[8] During this period, M\u00f6nchengladbach won the Bundesliga five times, the UEFA Cup twice and reached a European Cup final in 1977.\n\nSince 2004, Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach have played at Borussia-Park, having previously played at the B\u00f6kelbergstadion since 1919.

On 17 November 1899, thirteen of these young men formed a new club, this time specifically focused on association football, in the Zum J\u00e4gerhof pub. They chose the word Borussia (Latin: \"Prussia\") as their association's new title, although this was not yet the club's official founding. Borussia was chosen because M\u00f6nchengladbach was located in the western provinces awarded to the Kingdom of Prussia as part of the 1815 Congress of Vienna. Other notable football clubs in western Germany that chose the name \"Prussia\" as their title include Borussia Dortmund in 1909 and SC Preu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster in 1906.[12]",

During the Cold War, Union was based in East Berlin, joining the German league structure upon the reunification of the city and country in 1990.[4] From 2009 until 2019, they competed in the 2. Bundesliga, the second tier of German football. In 2019, Union won promotion to the Bundesliga for the first time in the club's history. In 2021, Union finished seventh in the league to qualify to the inaugural UEFA Europa Conference League. In 2022, the club qualified for the UEFA Europa League by finishing fifth. The following season, the club qualified for the Champions League for the first time in their history, by finishing fourth in the Bundesliga.\n\nThe home ground of the club is the Stadion An der Alten F\u00f6rsterei. It is the second-largest in the German capital and has been home to Union Berlin and its forerunners since it opened in 1920.[5] The stadium also hosts concerts and the annual Weihnachtssingen Christmas carols event.[6]\n\nAs of October 2024, Union Berlin has 67,638 official members.[7] The club has become well known for its enthusiastic and creative fan base and its chant \"Eisern Union\" (Iron Union).[8][9]\n\nHistory\nFirst foundation (1906\u20131945)\nThe name 1. FC Union Berlin was used by two football clubs that shared a common origin as FC Olympia Obersch\u00f6neweide, founded in 1906 in Obersch\u00f6neweide, which at that time was a suburb of Berlin. The side took on the name SC Union 06 Obersch\u00f6neweide in 1910.[10] Union was one of Berlin's premier clubs[according to whom?] in the interwar period, regularly winning local championships and competing at the national level, including an appearance in the 1923 German championship final which they lost 0\u20133 to Hamburger SV.\n\nEarly on, the team was nicknamed \"Schlosserjungs\" (English: metalworker-boys) because of their then all blue kit, reminiscent of the typical work clothing worn in the factories of the industrial Obersch\u00f6neweide district. The popular cry of Union supporters \u2013 \"Eisern Union!\" (Iron Union) \u2013 also emerged at this time.[11] Since its foundation the club has had a distinct working-class image,[according to whom?] in contrast to other local clubs with more middle-class origins, such as Viktoria 89 Berlin, Blau-Wei\u00df 90 Berlin, BSV 92 Berlin or Tennis Borussia Berlin.\n\nIn 1933, German football was reorganized under the Third Reich into 16 top-flight divisions known as Gauligen. Obersch\u00f6neweide became part of the Gauliga Berlin-Brandenburg, where they generally[according to whom?] earned middling,[vague] unexceptional[tone] results. They were relegated in 1935 and returned to first division play in 1936 after only one season's absence.[10] In 1940, the team finished first in Group B of the division and then defeated Blau-Wei\u00df 90 (1\u20132, 3\u20130) to win the overall division title. That advanced the club to the national playoffs where they were put out by Rapid Wien in the opening group round (2\u20133, 1\u20133).[10] Union resumed its place as an average side.[according to whom?] They were relegated again in 1942 and played the final war-shortened Gauliga season in 1944\u201345.",

Founded on 4 February 1899, Werder are best known for their professional association football team, who compete in the Bundesliga, the first tier of the German football league system. Bremen share the record for most seasons played in the Bundesliga with Bayern Munich, and are ranked third in the all-time Bundesliga table, only behind Bayern and Borussia Dortmund.[2]\n\nWerder have been German champions four times, have won the DFB-Pokal six times, the DFL-Ligapokal once, the DFL-Supercup thrice, and the European Cup Winners' Cup once.

On 10 September 1899, Werder won their first match 1\u20130, against ASC 1898 Bremen. In 1900, the club was one of the founder members of the German Football Association (DFB). Werder then had some early success, winning several local championships. In 1903, all three of their teams won their local leagues. Due to the club's popularity, Werder became the first side in the city to charge entry fees for home matches.[4]\n\nAfter the First World War, the club adopted other sports, such as athletics, baseball, chess, cricket, and tennis.[4] On 19 January 1920, the club took on their current name: Sportverein Werder Bremen. In 1922, it became the first club in Bremen to hire a professional coach, the Hungarian Ferenc K\u00f3nya. Werder made regular appearances in the play-offs of the Northern German football championship during the 1920s and early 1930s, but did not win any titles. In the mid-1930s, striker Matthias Heidemann became the club's first international.[4]\n\nWerder won the Gauliga Niedersachsen in 1933\u201334, and again in 1935\u201336, 1936\u201337, and 1941\u201342.[5] By winning the Gauliga, the team qualified for the national championship play-offs; Bremen's best result was a quarter-final place in 1942. As professionalism was not permitted in German football, several Werder players worked at the nearby Brinkmann tobacco factory; the side were subsequently nicknamed \"Texas 11\" after one of the company's cigarette brands.[6]\n\nBetween the end of the Second World War and the formation of the Bundesliga in 1963, the club was recognised as one of the top two teams in northern Germany, along with Hamburger SV. In 1960\u201361, Werder won their first DFB-Pokal, defeating 1. FC Kaiserslautern 2\u20130 in the final. The team consisted of future international Sepp Piontek, former international Willi Schr\u00f6der, and Arnold Sch\u00fctz, among others.[5] A second place in the 1962\u201363 Oberliga Nord, behind Hamburger SV, ensured Werder's place in the 1963\u201364 Bundesliga, the competition's inaugural season.[7] Werder won their first German championship in 1964\u201365, finishing three points ahead of 1. FC K\u00f6ln.[8] One of the team's key players was German international and defender Horst-Dieter H\u00f6ttges.[9] Werder finished runners-up in 1967\u201368; in the following years, they languished in the bottom half of the table.",

V., commonly known as FC Augsburg (German pronunciation: [\u025bf\u02cct\u0361se\u02d0 \u02c8a\u028a\u032fksb\u028a\u0281k] \u24d8), is a German professional football club based in Augsburg, Bavaria. FC Augsburg play in the Bundesliga, the top tier of the German football league system. The team was founded as Fu\u00dfball-Klub Alemannia Augsburg in 1907 and played as BC Augsburg from 1921 to 1969. With over 25,000 members,[1] it is the largest football club in Swabian Bavaria.\n\nThe club has spent most of its history fluctuating between the second and third divisions, with disappointment striking in the early 2000s when Augsburg were relegated to the fourth division for two seasons. However, the club experienced a surge following this setback, and was eventually promoted to the Bundesliga for the first time in 2011, where it has remained ever since. Augsburg have consolidated their Bundesliga status in the 2010s, finishing a record high fifth in the 2014\u201315 season before several mid-table finishes, and made their European debut in the 2015\u201316 UEFA Europa League, with the club reaching the Round of 32 before being knocked out by Liverpool 1\u20130 on aggregate.\n\nSince 2009, FC Augsburg's stadium has been the 30,660 capacity WWK ARENA, located south of Augsburg city centre and easily accessible via tram. The club, known as the Fuggerst\u00e4dter or simply as FCA, receive strong home support with an average attendance of 28,709 in the 2019\u201320 Bundesliga season (93.6% of stadium capacity). It is a single tier stadium with a standing terrace behind one of the goals, known as the Ulrich-Biesinger-Trib\u00fcne, and three seated stands with a standing section in the opposite corner to the Ulrich-Biesinger-Trib\u00fcne for away fans.\n\nAugsburg maintains fierce local rivalries with Ingolstadt and TSV 1860 Munich. Matches between these clubs typically attract large crowds, and a match in 1973 at 1860 Munich set the all-time spectator record for the Olympic Stadium. FCA regularly sell out their local Bavarian derby against Bayern Munich.\n\nThe club's colours are red, green and white which can be found across the club's kits while the club badge is similar to the Augsburg city emblem. The club's training facilities are situated next to the stadium while a club shop is located near Augsburg Hauptbahnhof in the city centre.\n\nA merger of Augsburg's two most successful clubs, TSV Schwaben and BC Augsburg, was discussed[by whom?] as early as the late 1940s, but distrust between the two sides and a fear that the other club would dominate the merger caused each side to hesitate, despite the financial trouble both clubs were in. A first serious meeting between the two sides was held in 1964, both clubs having dropped out of tier-one football by then. The leadership of the multi-sports club Schwaben was completely behind a merger, but the club's football department was not, and once more the process of forming FCA was stalled.[2] Traditionally, BCA saw itself as a working-class club, based in the north of Augsburg, while Schwaben was the club of the more affluent and based south of the city, with the river Wertach forming something of a boundary between the two clubs territories.[3]\n\nIn 1968, with BCA struggling in the third division after relegation from professional football the year before and Schwaben soon to follow, another effort was made. In April 1969, a high-level meeting between the two club bosses brought the decision to merge the clubs and name the new side FC Augsburg. FCA was to be a football club only, with no other sports department. The then-mayor of Augsburg, Hans Breuer, was one of the driving forces behind the move.[2]\n\nThe merger came at a time of on-the-field decline for both sides, Schwaben had just been relegated from the tier-two Regionalliga S\u00fcd and decided that an attempt to regain their status was financially impossible, while BCA narrowly missed out on promotion to the league that season. In June, 256 of 265 of BCA's members present voted for the merger while,[2] shortly after, 75 percent of Schwaben's members also approved the motion.[4]\n\nSchwaben, however, opted for the \"small solution\"\u2014the club was to remain independent with only its football department merging into the new club.[4] But even this move was not universally popular within the club, with some former members forming a new football club, Eintracht Augsburg, and restarting from the lowest level of the pyramid. For this reason, FCA is generally not considered[by whom?] to carry on the traditions of TSV Schwaben, only those of BC Augsburg. A year later, the footballers of Eintracht rejoined Schwaben but, since then, have always remained an amateur club. It took the new football department until 1981 to regain its third-division status, where they were to meet FCA for the first time in league football and renewed the Augsburg derby.[5]\n\nThe new FCA played its first game on 30 July 1969, when it met 1. FC N\u00fcrnberg in Augsburg in front of 13,000, losing 0\u20133 in extra time.[4]",

The club currently plays in the Bundesliga, the top tier of the German football league system.\n\nThe club was formed in the year of 2007 through the separation of the football section from parent association Heidenheimer Sportbund, a larger multi sports club that has 5,800 members in 25 departments.[3] The independence of the football side allows it to operate under the stricter economic standards set for professional clubs which are members of the German Football Association (Deutscher Fu\u00dfball-Bund or DFB).\n\nHeidenheimer SB itself was founded through the 1972 merger of TSB Heidenheim and VfL Heidenheim.[4] The club's origins go back to 14 August 1846, with the establishment of the gymnastics club Turngemeinde Heidenheim, which folded in 1852, but was re-constituted under the same name in 1861.[citation needed] The club was renamed Turnverein Heidenheim in 1872.\n\nA football department was created within the association on 8 July 1890 and became an independent side known as VfR Heidenheim on 21 August 1922.[citation needed] The swimming club Schwimmverein 04 Heidenheim joined VfR in 1936 to form VfL Heidenheim 04.[citation needed] In 1949, following World War II, these two clubs went their separate ways, the swimmers under their original name, and the footballers as VfL Heidenheim 1890.\n\nIn the meantime, parent club TV 1846 Heidenheim was joined on 13 July 1935 by SpVgg Heidenheim and then on 3 April 1937 merged with 1. Sportverein 1900 Heidenheim \u2013 which was known as Athletenklub Hellenstein until 1920 \u2013 to become TSV 1846 Heidenheim.[citation needed] After the war TSV was united with Turnerbund Heidenheim 1902 whose history was as a worker's club.[citation needed] TB was established on 21 December 1902 and was renamed Turnerbund Heidenheim on 6 August 1904.[citation needed] This club merged with Arbeiterturnverein 1904 Heidenheim on 8 March 1919.[citation needed] Like other worker's clubs, TB was considered as politically unacceptable by the Nazi regime and was forcibly dissolved in 1933. It was re-established after the war and on 3 February 1946 joined TSV 1846 Heidenheim to form TSB 1846 Heidenheim.\n\nThe 27 May 1972 merger of TSB and VfL brought all these threads together, returning the footballers to the fold of the original gymnastics club. Heidenheimer SB and predecessor VfL Heidenheim played in the Amateurliga W\u00fcrttemberg (III) from 1963 to 1975 and again from 1976 to 1979.[citation needed] Regional cup wins led to the team's participation in the opening round of the DFB-Pokal (German Cup) in 1975, 1978, and 1980, before the side slipped into lower-level competition.\n\nThe club has since recovered and in 2004 advanced to the Oberliga Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. In 2007, the football department decided to split off from Heidenheimer SB as a legally independent club with retrospective effect from 1 January 2007. A successful season finish in 2008 saw the club being promoted to the Regionalliga S\u00fcd. Having simultaneously won the W\u00fcrttemberg Cup, Heidenheim was allowed to participate in the first round of the DFB-Pokal in the following season, where the team lost 0\u20133 to VfL Wolfsburg.[6] In 2009, Heidenheim finished first in the Regionalliga S\u00fcd and got promoted to the 3. Liga.\n\nAfter five seasons in the 3. Liga with the club always finishing in the upper half of the table, 1. FC Heidenheim won the league in 2013\u201314, and earned promotion to the 2. Bundesliga for the first time. At the same time the club, however, withdrew its reserve team, playing in the Oberliga Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, from competition after such teams ceased to be compulsory for professional clubs.\n\nIn the 2019\u201320 season, 1. FC Heidenheim finished third to play against the 16th-placed Bundesliga club, Werder Bremen, in the promotion-relegation play-offs. The tie ended in a 2\u20132 draw on aggregate, as 1. FC Heidenheim lost on the away goals rule to stay in 2. Bundesliga.\n\nOn the final matchday of the 2022\u201323 season, 1. FC Heidenheim managed to score two goals in the stoppage time to win 3\u20132 against Jahn Regensburg, in which they finished top of the table ahead of Darmstadt on goal difference and promoted to the Bundesliga for the first time in their history.\n\nOn 17 September 2023, the club won their first ever Bundesliga match, in a 4\u20132 home victory against Werder Bremen, on the same day that head coach, Frank Schmidt, set the record as the longest serving manager in the history of German football.[11] An impressive Bundesliga campaign saw the club finish 8th in the 2023\u201324 season, comfortably securing safety, and with German champions Bayer Leverkusen's victory over Kaiserslautern in the DFB-Pokal final meant that Heidenheim qualified for their first European appearance, the UEFA Conference League play-offs in their debut Bundesliga season. On 29 August 2024, Heidenheim secure advance to Conference League League Phase for the first time in history after defeating Swedish club BK H\u00e4cken 3-2 at home and 5-3 on aggregate in the play-off round.",

The Turnverein zu Bochum was then formally established on 18 February 1849. In December 1851, however, the club was forcibly dissolved and banned by the Prussian provincial administration then reestablished on 19 June 1860 as the bochum gymnastics club. The club was reorganized in May 1904 as Turnverein zu Bochum, gegr\u00fcndet 1848 and formed a football department on 31 January 1911. On 1 April 1919, the club merged with Spiel und Sport 08 Bochum to form Turn- und Sportverein Bochum 1848. On 1 February 1924, the two clubs from the earlier merger split into the Bochumer Turnverein 1848 (gymnastics department) and Turn- und Sportverein Bochum 1908 (football, track and field, handball, hockey and tennis departments).\n\nThe Nazi regime forced Bochumer Turnverein 1848 to merge with Turn- und Sport Bochum 1908 and Sportverein Germania Vorw\u00e4rts Bochum 1906 into the current-day club VfL Bochum on 14 April 1938. After the merger, VfL Bochum continued to compete in the top flight as part of the Gauliga Westfalen.\n\nAs World War II progressed, play throughout Germany became increasingly difficult due to player shortages, travel problems and damage to football fields from Allied bombing raids. VfL became part of the wartime side Kriegsspielgemeinschaft VfL 1848/Preu\u00dfen Bochum alongside Preu\u00dfen 07 Bochum, before re-emerging as a separate side again after the war.[vague] Although they fielded competitive sides, they had the misfortune[tone] of playing in the same division as Schalke 04, which was the dominant team of the era. VfL's best result was therefore a distant second place in 1938\u201339.\n\nFollowing World War II, the football section resumed play as the independent VfL Bochum 1848 and played its first season in the second division 2. Oberliga West in 1949, while Preu\u00dfen Bochum went on to lower tier amateur level play.[citation needed] VfL won the division title in 1953 to advance to the Oberliga West for a single season.[citation needed] They repeated their divisional win in 1956 and returned to the top-flight until again being relegated after the 1960\u201361 season.\n\nWith the formation of the Bundesliga, Germany's new professional league, in 1963 VfL found itself in the third tier Amateurliga Westfalen.[citation needed] A first-place result there in 1965 raised them to the Regionalliga West (II),[citation needed] from which they began a steady climb up the league table to the Bundesliga in 1971.[citation needed] During this rise, Bochum also played its way to the final of the 1967\u201368 DFB-Pokal, where they lost 1\u20134 to 1. FC K\u00f6ln.\n\nIn spite of being a perennial lower table side, Bochum developed a reputation for tenaciousness[according to whom?] on the field in a run of 20 seasons in the top flight. The club made a repeat appearance in the DFB-Pokal final in 1988, losing 0\u20131 to Eintracht Frankfurt.[citation needed] Relegated after a 16th-place finish in the 1992\u201393 season, the team has become a classic \"yo-yo club\",[according to whom?] bouncing up and down[tone] between the Bundesliga and 2. Bundesliga. The club finished in 5th place in the Bundesliga in 1996\u201397 and 2003\u201304, which earned them appearances in the UEFA Cup.[citation needed] In 1997, they advanced to the third round, where they were eliminated by Ajax, and in 2004, they were eliminated early through away goals (0\u20130 and 1\u20131) by Standard Li\u00e8ge.\n\nIn the 2020\u201321 season, the club won the 2. Bundesliga, earning promotion to the Bundesliga.\n\nIn the 2023\u201324 season, the club was in a relegation playoff with Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf, however won 6\u20135 on penalties, after initially being 3\u20130 down in the first leg.",

Later the club concentrated on track and field athletics.\n\nKieler Fu\u00dfball-Club Holstein was formed on 4 May 1902 and was renamed Fu\u00dfball-Verein Holstein von 1902 (FV Holstein Kiel) sometime in 1908.[5] The club quickly became competitive and, in 1910, they reached the German championship final, where they lost 0\u20131 in extra time to Karlsruher FV. In 1912, they won the German championship with a 2\u20131 overtime semi-final victory over defending champions Viktoria 89 Berlin followed by a 1\u20130 win in the final over the previous year's champions, Karlsruher FV.[6] In 1914, the club renamed again after the new branches of hockey and athletics were added, becoming Sportverein Holstein von 1902.\n\nOn 7 June 1917, 1. Kieler Fussball Verein von 1900 and Sportverein Holstein von 1902, severely weakened by World War I, merged to form the current day club. The new association adopted the foundation date of the older club, while taking up the ground, kit, colours, logo and the name Holstein from SV Holstein Kiel.[citation needed] Through the 1920s, the team made regular appearances in the national playoffs and in 1926 reached the semi-finals where they were eliminated 1\u20133 by SpVgg Greuther F\u00fcrth.[citation needed] In 1930, they played their way to the final, losing 4\u20135 to Hertha BSC.[7] The following year they reached the semi-finals where they were eliminated 0\u20132 by TSV 1860 Munich.\n\nUnder the Third Reich, German football was re-organized into sixteen top flight divisions. Kiel played in the Gauliga Nordmark, but failed to attain a title. In 1942, the Gauliga Nordmark was broken up into the Gauliga Hamburg and Gauliga Schleswig-Holstein.[citation needed] No longer in the company of Hamburger SV and other strong teams from the city, Kiel immediately won the title of the new division and defended it over the next two seasons until the end of World War II brought play to a halt across the country.\n\nThose titles earned Kiel entry into the national playoff rounds. They made their best run in 1943 when they advanced as far as the semi-finals before losing to eventual champions Dresdner SC. The team secured third place by defeating First Vienna FC. The next year, they were eliminated early on and no final was played in 1945.",

        "Description": "Football Club Internazionale Milano, commonly referred to as Internazionale (pronounced [\u02ccinternattsjo\u02c8na\u02d0le]) or simply Inter, and colloquially known as Inter Milan in English-speaking countries, is an Italian professional football club based in Milan, Lombardy. Inter is the only Italian side to have always competed in top flight of Italian football since its debut in 1909.\n\nFounded in 1908 following a schism within the Milan Foot-Ball and Cricket Club (now AC Milan), Inter won its first championship in 1910. Since its formation, the club has won 36 domestic trophies, including 20 league titles, nine Coppa Italia, and eight Supercoppa Italiana. From 2006 to 2010, the club won five successive league titles, equalling the all-time record at that time. They have won the European Cup/Champions League three times: two back-to-back in 1964 and 1965, and then another in 2010. Their latest win completed an unprecedented Italian seasonal treble, with Inter winning the Coppa Italia and the Scudetto the same year. The club has also won three UEFA Cups, two Intercontinental Cups and one FIFA Club World Cup.\n\nInter's home games are played at the San Siro stadium, which they share with city rivals AC Milan. The stadium is the largest in Italian football with a capacity of 75,817. They have long-standing rivalries with Milan, with whom they contest the Derby della Madonnina, and Juventus, with whom they contest the Derby d'Italia; their rivalry with the former is one of the most followed derbies in football.[11] As of 2024, Inter has the highest home game attendance in Italy and the fourth-highest attendance in Europe. Since May 2024, the club has been owned by American asset management company Oaktree Capital Management. Inter is one of the most valuable clubs in Italian and world football.\n\nThe club was founded on 9 March 1908 as Football Club Internazionale, when a group of players left the Milan Cricket and Football Club (now AC Milan) to form a new club because they wanted to accept more foreign players. The name of the club derives from the wish of its founding members to accept foreign players as well as Italians. The club won its first championship in 1910 and its second in 1920. The captain and coach of the first championship winning team was Virgilio Fossati, who was later killed in battle while serving in the Italian army during World War I.\n\nIn 1922, Inter was at risk of relegation to the second division, but they remained in the top league after winning two play-offs.\n\nSix years later, during the Fascist era, the club merged with the Unione Sportiva Milanese and, for political reasons, was renamed Societ\u00e0 Sportiva Ambrosiana.[22] During the 1928\u201329 season, the team wore white jerseys with a red cross emblazoned on it; the jersey's design was inspired by the flag and coat of arms of the city of Milan.[23] In 1929, the new club chairman Oreste Simonotti changed the club's name to Associazione Sportiva Ambrosiana and restored the previous black-and-blue jerseys; however, supporters continued to call the team Inter, and in 1931 new chairman Pozzani succumbed to shareholder pressure and changed the name to Associazione Sportiva Ambrosiana-Inter.",

        "Description": "Juventus Football Club (from Latin: iuvent\u016bs, 'youth'; Italian pronunciation: [ju\u02c8v\u025bntus]), commonly known as Juventus or colloquially as Juve (pronounced [\u02c8ju\u02d0ve]), is an Italian professional football club based in Turin, Piedmont, who compete in Serie A, the top tier of the Italian football league system. Founded in 1897 by a group of Torinese students, the club played in different grounds around the city, being the latter the Juventus Stadium.\n\nNicknamed la Vecchia Signora (\"the Old Lady\"), it has won 36 official league titles, 15 Coppa Italia trophies and nine Italian Super Cups, being the record holder for all these competitions; they also hold two Intercontinental Cups, two European Cup / UEFA Champions Leagues, one European Cup Winners' Cup, three UEFA Cups (Italian record), two UEFA Super Cups and one UEFA Intertoto Cup (Italian record). Consequently, the side leads the historical Federazione Italiana Giuoco Calcio (FIGC) classification, whilst on the international stage the club occupies the sixth position in Europe and the twelfth in the world for most confederation titles won with eleven trophies, as well as the fourth in the all-time Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) competitions ranking, having obtained the highest coefficient score during seven seasons since its introduction in 1979, the most for an Italian team in both cases and joint second overall in the last cited.\n\nFounded with the name of Sport-Club Juventus, initially as an athletics club, it is the second oldest of its kind still active in the country after Genoa's football section (1893) and has competed every season of the premier club division (reformulated in different formats until the Serie A inception in 1929) since its debut in 1900 with the exception of the 2006\u201307 season, being managed by the industrial Agnelli family almost continuously since 1923. The relationship between the club and that dynasty is the oldest and longest in national sports, making Juventus one of the first professional sporting clubs ante litteram in the country, having established itself as a major force in the national stage since the 1930s and at confederation level since the mid-1970s, and becoming, in a nearly stable basis, one of the top-ten wealthiest in world football in terms of value, revenue and profit since the mid-1990s, being listed on the Borsa Italiana since 2001.\n\nUnder the management of Giovanni Trapattoni, the club won 13 trophies in the ten years before 1986, including six league titles and five international tournaments, and became the first to win all three seasonal competitions organised by the Union of European Football Associations: the 1976\u201377 UEFA Cup (first Southern European side to do so), the 1983\u201384 Cup Winners' Cup and the 1984\u201385 European Champions' Cup.[17] With successive triumphs in the 1984 European Super Cup and 1985 Intercontinental Cup, it became the first and thus far only in the world to complete a clean sweep of all five historical confederation trophies; an achievement that they revalidated with the title won in the 1999 UEFA Intertoto Cup after another successful era led by Marcello Lippi, becoming in addition, until 2022, the only professional Italian club to have won every ongoing honour available to the first team and organised by a national or international football association. In December 2000, Juventus was placed seventh in the FIFA's historic ranking of the best clubs in the world, and nine years later was ranked second best club in Europe during the 20th century based on a statistical study series by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics (IFFHS), the highest for an Italian club in both.\n\nThe club's fan base is the largest at national level and one of the largest worldwide. Unlike most European sporting supporters' groups, which are often concentrated around their own club's city of origin, it is widespread throughout the whole country and the Italian diaspora, making Juventus a symbol of anticampanilismo (\"anti-parochialism\") and italianit\u00e0 (\"Italianness\"). Juventus players have won eight Ballon d'Or awards, four of these in consecutive years (1982\u20131985, an overall joint record), among these Michel Platini as well as three of the five recipients with Italian nationality as the first player representing Serie A, Omar S\u00edvori, and the former member of the youth sector Paolo Rossi; they have also won four FIFA World Player of the Year awards, with winners as Roberto Baggio and Zinedine Zidane, a national record and third and joint second highest overall, respectively, in the cited prizes. Finally, the club has also provided the most players to the Italy national team\u2014mostly in official competitions in almost uninterrupted way since 1924\u2014who often formed the group that led the Azzurri squad to international success, most importantly in the 1934, 1982 and 2006 FIFA World Cups.",

During the 1991\u201392 season, the club notably achieved the feat of being the first team to win the Serie A title without losing a single game.[13] Milan is home to multiple Ballon d'Or winners, and three of the club's players, Marco van Basten, Ruud Gullit, and Frank Rijkaard, were ranked in the top three on the podium for the 1988 Ballon d'Or, an unprecedented achievement in the history of the prize.[14]\n\nDomestically, Milan has won 19 league titles,[15] 5 Coppa Italia titles and 7 Supercoppa Italiana titles.[16] In international competitions, Milan is Italy's most successful club.[nb 1][16][17][18][19] The club has won seven European Cup/Champions League titles, making them the competition's second-most successful team behind Real Madrid, and further honours include five UEFA Super Cups, two UEFA Cup Winners' Cups, a joint record[nb 2] two Latin Cups, a joint record[nb 3] three Intercontinental Cups and one FIFA Club World Cup.[16]\n\nMilan is one of the wealthiest clubs in Italian and world football.[20] It was a founding member of the now-defunct G-14 group of Europe's leading football clubs as well as its replacement, the European Club Association.[21]",

        "Description": "Atalanta Bergamasca Calcio, commonly referred to as Atalanta, is a professional football club based in Bergamo, Lombardy, Italy, who compete in Serie A, the top tier of the Italian league system.\n\nFounded in 1907, Atalanta holds the record for having played the most Serie A seasons (63) without being based in a regional capital and without having won the league title. Furthermore, the club also holds the record for most promotions to the Serie A[a] and the joint-most Serie B titles, alongside Genoa.\n\nAtalanta won the Coppa Italia in 1963 and the UEFA Europa League in 2023\u201324.[4] The club qualified for the UEFA Champions League four times, reaching the quarter-finals in 2020, and participated in six seasons of the UEFA Europa League (previously known as the UEFA Cup).[b] Atalanta also reached the semi-finals of the Cup Winners' Cup in 1988, when it was competing in Serie B. This is still the joint-best performance ever by a non-first division club in a major UEFA competition.[c]\n\nThe club plays its home games at the Gewiss Stadium and its main kit colors are black and blue. Atalanta has a long-standing rivalry with nearby club Brescia.[5][6] The club is also famed for its youth academy, which has produced several notable talents who have played in the top leagues of Europe.[7]\n\nAtalanta was founded on 17 October 1907 by students of the Liceo Classico Paolo Sarpi and was named after the female athlete of the same name from Greek mythology.[8] Though it immediately established a football sector,[9] it was not the first football association based in Bergamo: Football Club Bergamo was founded by Swiss emigrants in 1904[10] and was absorbed into another club, Bergamasca, in 1911. The Italian Football Federation did not recognize Atalanta until 1914, and in 1919 announced that it would only allow one club from Bergamo to compete in the highest national league (then called the Prima Categoria).[11] As Atalanta and Bergamasca were rivals and did not come to an agreement, admission to the Prima Categoria was decided by a playoff match; Atalanta won this match 2\u20130.[12] A merger between the two clubs nevertheless occurred in 1920, forming the new club Atalanta Bergamasca di Ginnastica e Scherma 1907 (shortened to Atalanta Bergamasca Calcio) and establishing its black and blue (nerazzurri) colors.[11][13]\n\nAtalanta competed in the Seconda Divisione, the second tier, during the early 1920s.[14] In the 1927\u201328 season, the club won its group and subsequently defeated Pistoiese in the playoffs to win promotion and its first second division league triumph.[15] The club inaugurated its current home stadium in the Borgo Santa Caterina neighborhood in 1928,[16] and was admitted to Serie B, the second tier of the restructured Italian league, in 1929.[17][18] After almost a decade in Serie B, Atalanta achieved its first promotion to Serie A in 1937 under coach Ottavio Barbieri,[19] though was relegated at the end of the season. The club returned to Serie A in 1940 as champion of Serie B.[14]\n\nDuring the 1940s, Atalanta performed consistently in the top flight, though the national league was halted between 1943 and 1945 due to World War II.[20] Atalanta achieved a fifth-place finish in the 1947\u201348 Serie A under coach Ivo Fiorentini, its highest league finish until 2017.[21][22] The club earned a reputation as the provinciale terribile (terrible provincial team) during this time as a result of its successes against well-known metropolitan teams such as the Grande Torino, who won Serie A five times during the 1940s.[21][23] Atalanta achieved mid-table finishes during much of the 1950s and remained in Serie A until 1958,[14] when it was relegated due to accusations of match fixing. These accusations were found to be false a year later, after the club returned to Serie A by winning its second Serie B title.[24]",

In its history, Napoli has won three Serie A titles, six Coppa Italia titles, two Supercoppa Italiana titles, and one UEFA Cup.[1]\n\nThe club was formed in 1926 as Associazione Calcio Napoli following the merger of US Internazionale Napoli and Naples Foot-Ball Club. Napoli saw relatively little success in its early years, winning their first major trophy in the 1962 Coppa Italia. Napoli then saw increased success in the late 1970s (including their second Coppa Italia in 1976) and especially in the 1980s, after the club acquired Diego Maradona in 1984. During his time in Naples, Maradona helped the team win several trophies, which led to the club retiring his number 10 jersey. During this period, Napoli won two league titles (in 1987 and 1990), the 1987 Coppa Italia, the 1990 Supercoppa Italiana, and their only European trophy with the 1989 UEFA Cup. Following his departure, however, Napoli struggled financially, and endured several relegations and a bankruptcy, prior to being re-founded in 2004 by film producer Aurelio De Laurentiis. Under his leadership, the club has stabilized, which has led to renewed on-field success, winning 2005\u201306 Serie C1, the 2012, 2014, and 2020 Coppa Italia titles, and the 2014 Supercoppa Italiana, eventually culminating in their third league title in 2023, the first since Maradona's departure.\n\nBy attendance, Napoli have the fourth-largest fan base in Italy,[2] and were ranked as the fifth highest-earning football club in Serie A, with $182 million in revenue during the 2017\u201318 season.[3] In 2018, Forbes estimated the club is the fifth most valuable club in Italy, worth $379 million. Napoli are also one of the associate members of the European Club Association.\n\nSince 1959, the club has played their home games at the Stadio San Paolo, which was renamed Stadio Diego Armando Maradona after the Argentine striker's death in 2020. Napoli traditionally wear sky blue shirts, white shorts, and sky blue socks at home and white shirts, white or sky blue shorts, and white or sky blue socks away; this is derived from the shirts of Naples FBC and the shorts of Internazionale Napoli after the clubs merged to form Napoli's predecessor Internaples in 1922. Napoli have rivalries with Juventus, Roma, Inter Milan and AC Milan. The club's anthem is \"Napoli\", one of the major hits of the Neapolitan singer Nino D'Angelo.[4]",

Founded by a merger in 1927, Roma has participated in the top tier of Italian football for all of its existence, except for the 1951\u201352 season. Roma has won Serie A three times, in 1941\u201342, 1982\u201383 and 2000\u201301, as well as nine Coppa Italia titles and two Supercoppa Italiana titles. In European competitions, Roma won the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1960\u201361 and the UEFA Conference League in 2021\u201322, while they finished runners-up in the 1983\u201384 European Cup, the 1990\u201391 UEFA Cup and the 2022\u201323 UEFA Europa League.\n\nSixteen players have won the FIFA World Cup while playing at Roma: Attilio Ferraris and Enrique Guaita (1934); Guido Masetti and Eraldo Monzeglio (1934 and 1938); Aldo Donati and Pietro Serantoni (1938); Bruno Conti (1982); Rudi V\u00f6ller and Thomas Berthold (1990); Aldair (1994); Vincent Candela (1998); Cafu (2002); Daniele De Rossi, Simone Perrotta and Francesco Totti (2006); Paulo Dybala (2022).\n\nSince 1953, Roma has played home matches at the Stadio Olimpico, a venue the club shares with city rivals Lazio. With a capacity of over 72,000, the stadium is the second-largest of its kind in Italy, with only the San Siro able to seat more. The club plans to move to a new stadium, though it is yet to start construction. Having a strong local rivalry, Roma and Lazio contest the Derby della Capitale.\n\nThe club's home colours are carmine red and golden yellow, which gives Roma its nickname \"I Giallorossi\" (\"The Yellow and Reds\"). These colours have often been combined with white shorts. The club badge features a she-wolf, an allusion to the founding myth of Rome.\n\nAS Roma was founded in the spring of 1927 when Italo Foschi[2] initiated the merger of three older Italian Football Championship clubs from the city of Rome: Roman FC, SS Alba-Audace and Fortitudo-Pro Roma SGS.[2] Foschi was an important Roman representative of the ruling National Fascist Party.[3][4]\n\nThe purpose of the merger was to give the Italian capital a strong club to rival that of the more dominant Northern Italian clubs of the time.[2] The only major Roman club to resist the merger was Lazio because of the intervention of the army General Vaccaro, a member of the club and executive of Italian Football Federation (FIGC). All three founding clubs were relegated, but the fascist-aligned FIGC bet over the capacity of the new team to give a stronger representation to the capital of Italy, and they were awarded a wild card for the Divisione Nazionale, the Serie A forerunner. The club played its earliest seasons at the Motovelodromo Appio stadium,[5] before settling in the working-class streets of Testaccio, where it built an all-wooden ground Campo Testaccio; this was opened in November 1929.[6] An early season in which Roma made a large mark was the 1930\u201331 championship, where the club finished as runners-up behind Juventus.[7] Captain Attilio Ferraris, along with Guido Masetti, Fulvio Bernardini and Rodolfo Volk, were highly important players during this period.[8]",

Bologna changed ownership multiple times during the early 2000s and 2010s, due to financial mismanagement, and later stabilized under the guise of a Canadian consortium led by Joey Saputo.\n\nBologna have participated in 75 Serie A seasons, which is the ninth-most in Italian football history. The club have played in the Stadio Renato Dall'Ara since 1927, which is the tenth-largest stadium by capacity in Serie A.\n\nBologna Football Club's formation was orchestrated by Emilio Arnstein, an Austrian who became interested in football at university in Vienna and Prague. He and his brother had previously founded another football club, Black Star, in Austria.\n\nThe club was founded on 3 October 1909, in the Northern Italian city of Bologna. Upon its formation, Carlo Sandoni was the club's sponsor and general manager, Swiss Louis Rauch became president, nobleman Guido Della Valle was the vice-president, Enrico Penaglia secretary, Sergio Lampronti cashier, while Emilio Arnstein and Leone Vincenzi were appointed councilmen.\n\nOn 20 March 1910, Bologna played their first ever game, against Virtus, who wore white shirts. Bologna outclassed their opponents, winning 9\u20131. The first football squad featured; Koch, Chiara, Pessarelli, Bragaglia, Guido Della Valle, Nanni, Donati, Rauch, Bernabeu, Mezzano, and Gradi.\n\nTheir formative season was spent in the regional league under Arrigo Gradi as captain, Bologna won their league gaining promotion to a league named Group Veneto-Emiliano. They spent four seasons in this league, never finishing lower than fifth. Bologna were entered into the Northern League before all football leagues were postponed for World War I.\n\nChampions: 1920s and 1930s\nAfter the first war, Bologna began to become more successful. First reaching the semi-finals of the Northern Italian competition in 1919\u201320, they went one better the following season by reaching the Northern League finals, going out 2\u20131 to Pro Vercelli. They would equal this again in 1923\u201324, coming runner up to eventual national champions Genoa.\n\nBologna became Northern and National League champions for the first time during 1924\u201325, beating Genoa CFC after five hard-fought final matches to take the championship. The finals against the Ligurian giants were marred by heavy crowd troubles. A few seasons later Bologna became champions of Italy for the second time in 1928\u201329 giving them a foothold in Italian football, building up a legacy, this was the last time the league was competed in the old system, Serie A was instated the following year.",

The team won the Serie A championship in the 1984\u201385 season.\n\nFounded in 1903 by a group of Greek students, the club was named Hellas (the Greek word for Greece), at the request of a professor of classics.[2] At a time in which football was played seriously only in the larger cities of northwestern Italy, most of Verona was indifferent to the growing sport. However, when in 1906 two city teams chose the city's Roman amphitheatre as a venue to showcase the game, crowd enthusiasm and media interest began to rise.\n\nDuring these first few years, Hellas was one of three or four area teams playing at a municipal level while fighting against city rivals Bentegodi to become the city's premier football outfit. By the 1907\u201308 season, Hellas was playing against regional teams, and an intense rivalry with Vicenza that has lasted to this day was born.\n\nFrom 1898 to 1926, Italian football was organised into regional groups. In this period, Hellas was one of the founding teams of the early league and often among its top final contenders. In 1911, the city helped Hellas replace the early, gritty football fields with a proper venue. This allowed the team to take part in its first regional tournament, which until 1926, was the qualifying stage for the national title.\n\nIn 1919, following a return to activity after a four-year suspension of all football competition in Italy during World War I, the team merged with city rival Verona and changed its name to Hellas Verona. Between 1926 and 1929, the elite \"Campionato Nazionale\" assimilated the top sides from the various regional groups. Hellas Verona joined the privileged teams, yet struggled to remain competitive.\n\nSerie A, as it is structured today, began in 1929, when the Campionato Nazionale turned into a professional league.

The club currently plays home matches at the 16,416-seat Unipol Domus.\n\nFounded in 1920, they won their first and only Scudetto in 1969\u201370, when they were led by the Italian national team's all-time leading scorer, Gigi Riva. The triumph was also the first by a club from south of Rome.

They spent the 1950s from then on in Serie B, losing a promotion play-off in 1954. After descending to Serie C in the early 1960s, Cagliari's rise would be meteoric, eventually achieving promotion to Serie A in 1964.\n\nThe squad for the Rossoblu's debut season in Serie A featured players like defender Mario Martiradonna, midfielders Pierluigi Cera, Nen\u00e9 and Ricciotti Greatti, and forward Gigi Riva. A poor first half of the season, however, saw Cagliari in last place with nine points at the halfway mark. An astonishing second half of the season saw Cagliari defeat the likes of Juventus and Milan and finish in seventh place with 34 points. Two seasons later, Riva finished as Serie A's top scorer for the first time while Cagliari finished with the league's best defensive record.",

Founded in 1920, the side is part of a select group of Italian football clubs not based in a provincial capital city that have participated in Serie A.[1]\n\nEmpoli has spent most of its history in professional football.[2] Empoli competed in European competitions once, in which they were eliminated in the qualification stage of 2007\u201308 UEFA Cup.[3]\n\nIn August 1920 in Empoli , Foot Ball Club Empoli and the football section Unione Sportiva Empoli were born. After the participation of a tournament in San Miniato, the two merged into a single local football club. The next season, the new club, after having obtained in September affiliation in the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) ratified by the Tuscan Regional Committee, was included in Group A of the Tuscan Promozione 1921\u201322, but did take part due to economic problems, choosing instead to join the league of Terza Categoria, where the team achieved second place in the group A.[1]\n\nIn the 1922\u201323 season, Empoli finished in second place in Group A of the Terza Categoria, gaining admission to the final round after winning the play-off in Florence, held on 15 April 1923 against Pontedera, 1\u20130. The season concluded with a third place in the group final.[1]\n\nFrom 1923 to 1926, Empoli continued to play in the Tuscan third division. Then, in the 1926\u201327 season, Empoli won the Group A division of Tuscany, and was admitted to the interregional finals; thanks to a fourth place in Group G, the Tuscans were promoted in the North Division of the Second Division 1927\u201328, the third Italian football tier of the era. In the following season the team was then inserted in Group C of the North Division, which concluded in fourth place, but for economic reasons refused the invitation to take part in the next championship of Prima Divisione, and therefore followed the downgrading of the Seconda Divisione from third to fourth tier. However, already the following season, in the 1928\u201329 Seconda Divisione, the club won promotion, winning the Tuscan championship, and returned to the North Division of Prima Divisione.[1]\n\nEmpoli was in the Prima Divisione, then Serie C, until the 1935\u201336 season, when the team withdrawn halfway through the season because of the call to arms for many of its players. Empoli resumed competitive activity from Prima Divisione the next season, under the name of OND Empoli, with the colours gray and blue; the team won the Tuscan Group A again gaining admission in Serie C. Until the shutdown from the causes of war, Empoli played in Serie C, obtaining a best result of sixth place in 1938\u201339. Meanwhile, the club was renamed OND Interaziendale Italo Gambaccioni Section Soccer from 1938 to 1941, until the name was changed again to Associazione Calcio Empol. On 15 September 1935, Empoli debuted in the Coppa Italia with a 1\u20130 home success against Pontedera.\n\nAfter World War II, Empoli took up the club name of Empoli Foot Ball Club after being called Sports Group Azelio Landi for a brief period between October and November 1944, and was admitted into Serie B thanks to a third-place finish in the 1945\u201346 season. In Serie B, Empoli played for four consecutive seasons, finishing in third place in the 1946\u201347 season. Relegation of the club \u2013 which by then had adopted the colour blue \u2013 occurred at the end of 1949\u201350 championship. The permanence in Serie C lasted for six seasons: in the summer of 1955, the club sold most of its players and at the end of the 1955\u201356 season, the Tuscan side were relegated to Serie D. After three seasons in the fourth division, in 1959\u201360 the Azzurri risked relegation to the regional level after finishing in 15th place, on equal points with Carrarese and Rieti. The club managed to escape relegation before drawing with Carrarese and then surpassing Lazio, in Pesaro, with a goal from Vezzosi. In 1960\u201361, Empoli returned to the third tier of Italian football, but for only one season, again suffering relegation.\n\nThe club returned to Serie C on 9 June 1963 after beating Tempio 2\u20130 in the play-off in Genoa. The club's permanence in the third tier of Italian football, then called Serie C1, lasted for 20 years until the 1982\u201383 season.",

The club's last honour was winning the Coupe de France in 1997 after defeating Guingamp 4\u20133 on penalties in the final. Nice's colours are red and black.\n\nDuring the club's successful run in the 1950s, Nice was among the first French clubs to successfully integrate international players into the fold. Notable players include H\u00e9ctor De Bourgoing, Pancho Gonzales, Victor Nurenberg, and Joaqu\u00edn Valle, the latter being the club's all-time leading goalscorer and arguably the greatest player.[3]",

Alongside Nantes, Rennes is one of the top football clubs in the region and the two are among the main clubs that contest the Derby Breton. The club's best finish in the league has been third, accomplishing this feat after the season was ended prematurely in 2019\u201320. Rennes has won three Coupe de France titles in 1965, 1971 and 2019. After winning the Coupe de France in 1971, Rennes changed its name to its current version, but the club's home colours have been the same since its inception, which are red, black, and white.\n\nRennes is known for its youth academy, known in English as the Henri Gu\u00e9rin Training Centre, which was formed in 2000. In 2010, the French Football Federation (FFF) recognised Rennes as having the best youth academy in the country.[3] The cornerstone of the academy is the under-19 team, which has won the Coupe Gambardella three times in 1973, 2003 and 2008.

Its became a professional club in 1933. It is currently playing in Ligue 1, the top tier of French football, since winning the 2016\u201317 Ligue 2 championship. This comes after the club was demoted to the fifth tier of French football at the conclusion of the 2010\u201311 Championnat National season after going into financial liquidation. Renamed RC Strasbourg Alsace, they won the CFA championship in 2012\u201313, and became Championnat National champions in 2015\u201316. Stade de la Meinau has been the club's stadium since 1914.\n\nRC Strasbourg is one of six clubs to have won all three major French trophies: the Championship in 1979; the Coupe de France in 1951, 1966 and 2001; and the Coupe de la Ligue in 1964, 1997, 2005 and 2019. It is also among the six teams to have played more than 2,000 games in France's top flight (spanning 56 seasons)[2] and has taken part in 52 European games since 1961.[3] By contrast, it has also experienced relegation at least once a decade since the early 1950s. It has changed its manager 52 times in 75 years of professional play.\n\nThe destiny of the RC Strasbourg has always been wedded to the history of Alsace. Like the region, the club has changed nationality three times and has a troubled history. Founded in what was then a part of the German Empire, the club from the beginning insisted on its Alsatian and popular roots, in opposition to the first Strasbourg-based clubs which came from the German-born bourgeoisie. When Alsace was returned to France in 1919, the club changed its name from \"1. FC Neudorf\" to the current \"Racing Club de Strasbourg\", in imitation of Pierre de Coubertin's Racing Club de France, a clear gesture of francophilia. RC Strasbourg players lived through World War II as most Alsatians did: evacuated in 1939, annexed in 1940 and striving to avoid nazification and incorporation in the Wehrmacht between 1942 and 1944. When Alsace was definitively returned to France, Strasbourg's identity switched towards Jacobinism with, for example, emotional wins in the cup in 1951 and 1966 amidst Franco-Alsatian controversies.",

The name \"Racing Club de Lens\" was chosen as a reference to Racing Club de Roubaix and Racing Club de France, both popular clubs at the time.\n\nThe club's first board of directors was formed by the parents of those students. The club originally played in green and black to represent the founding location; they wore green to represent the name of the home pitch, \"Verte\", (meaning 'green' in French), and black to represent the omnipresence of the coal mining industry in the surrounding area.\n\nBetween 1907 and 1912, the players were forced to change home grounds twice before settling at the Parc des Glissoires, situated between Avion and Lens.\n\nDuring World War I, in common with all French sports clubs, the team's activities were stopped and did not restart until 1919. By this time, Lens had changed their playing colours to sky blue.",

The club has played 31 seasons in the French top flight.\n\nThe team was founded in 1919, the same year the FFF was founded.[1]\n\nDuring the team's history, it has bounced between the top two tiers on multiple occasions. However, it did spend time in the third tier on several occasions; the 2006\u201307 season was its last season in the third tier.\n\nThe first season that Angers debuted in the French second division was in 1945. During this season, Angers SCO was placed in the North group; at that time, the second division was split into two groups, the North and South. Angers finished third, being seven points short of Stade Fran\u00e7ais, which was promoted to the first division. In the 2014\u201315 Ligue 2 season, the team achieved promotion after a long time being in the lower division. During the 2015\u201316 Ligue 1 season, SCO placed ninth in the final standings. In its opening league match against Montpellier, Angers won the match 2\u20130.\n\nOn 28 May 2017 Angers played in the 2017 Coupe de France final against Paris Saint-Germain.

The ban was effective for the summer 2021 transfer window.[6] On 27 April 2023, Angers received a two-window transfer ban from FIFA due to a dispute with Tunisian club ES Tunis over the transfer of Ilyes Chetti.[7] Angers communicated their intent to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).[8] In the 2022\u201323 Ligue 1 season, Angers suffered relegation with five matches to spare, returning to the second tier after eight years in the top flight.[9]",

Its name seems to be a tribute to Vit\u00f3ria de Set\u00fabal, which at the time was a top contender for the Campeonato de Portugal, though these days Guimar\u00e3es supporters downplay the connection. After seasons of hard work, which culminated in winning several titles in Braga's AF league, the Conquistadores were promoted to the Primeira Liga in 1941, and two seasons later battled the Sadinos from Set\u00fabal for the first time in the League.

Those years were marked by the decline of the leadership of Pimenta Machado, former club president, who was accused on charges of embezzlement. In February 2008 he was sentenced to four years and three months of prison on a suspended sentence,[5] though a year later he was cleared of this charge and instead ordered to pay a \u20ac4,000 fine for falsifying a document.[6]",

Founded in 1951, the club plays in the Primeira Liga, holding home games at Est\u00e1dio Municipal de Arouca, with a 5,600-seat capacity.\n\nFounded on 25 December 1951, as a FC Porto subsidiary,[1] Arouca spent the first five decades of its existence in the Aveiro regional leagues. In only two years (2006\u201308) it managed to reach the third division, being managed by television (RTP) presenter Jorge Gabriel for a few months during that timeframe.[2]\n\nArouca managed its fourth promotion in only seven years at the end of 2012\u201313, reaching the Primeira Liga for the first time in its history.[3][4] Subsequently, the Arouca Municipality awarded the club the Medal of Gold Merit for its achievement,[5] with the organization also being granted extra financial means to renovate and expand its stadium.[6]\n\nIn 2015\u201316 under Lito Vidigal, Arouca finished a best-ever fifth place, qualifying for the first time to the UEFA Europa League.[7] After beating Heracles Almelo of the Netherlands on the away goals rule, they lost the play-off 3\u20131 after extra time to Olympiacos of Greece.[8] A year after their peak finish, Arouca were relegated, ending their four years at the top.[9]\n\nA two-year spell in the second division for Arouca ended in May 2019 when on the last day of the season, they lost to U.D. Oliveirense and Varzim S.C. defeated Acad\u00e9mica de Coimbra; this ended nine years in the professional leagues.[10] The 2019\u201320 season was truncated due to the COVID-19 pandemic and Arouca and Vizela were due to be promoted because of their final position; competitors Olhanense successfully appealed at the Court of Arbitration for Sport for these promotions to be suspended.[11]",

The club is named after the Ave River, which flows through the town and into the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nFounded in 1939, they play their home matches at Est\u00e1dio do Rio Ave, also known as the Est\u00e1dio dos Arcos. Built in 1985, the current stadium seats approximately 12,815 people.\n\nThe club's home colours are green and white striped shirts. Meanwhile, the shorts and socks have historically alternated between green or white.[2] Portuguese internationals Alfredo, Paulinho Santos, Quim, Rui Jorge and F\u00e1bio Coentr\u00e3o started their careers at the club. Goalkeepers Jan Oblak and Ederson are some famous talents that were part of this side.\n\nThe Vilacondenses' best top-tier league finish was fifth in the 1981\u201382, 2017\u201318 and 2019\u201320 seasons.[3] They reached the 1984 Ta\u00e7a de Portugal Final, where they lost to Porto 4\u20131,[4] and the 2014 Ta\u00e7a de Portugal Final, where they lost to Benfica 1\u20130.[5] With this result, Rio Ave qualified for the 2014\u201315 UEFA Europa League, their first participation in a major European competition.\n\nRio Ave was founded in 1939, soon being nicknamed Rio Grande (Big River). The side had two of its best moments in the 1980s, under the management of F\u00e9lix Mourinho, father of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho: in 1981\u201382, the club finished in a joint-best fifth place, and two years later it reached the Ta\u00e7a de Portugal final, losing to Porto 4\u20131.[6]\n\nIn 2013\u201314, the club reached both cup finals under the management of Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo, but lost to treble-winners Benfica in both. This qualified them to their first European campaign, the 2014\u201315 UEFA Europa League.[7] New manager Pedro Martins led them past Swedish duo IFK G\u00f6teborg and IF Elfsborg to reach the group stage, where they came last.\n\nUnder Miguel Cardoso, Rio Ave came fifth in 2017\u201318, equalling their best finish.[8] Two years later, with Carlos Carvalhal in charge and Iranian Mehdi Taremi the league's joint top scorer, the club equalled this position with a new points record of 55.[9] In October 2020, the team reached the Europa League playoffs but lost at home to A.C. Milan, having conceded a penalty equaliser in the last minute of extra time and then losing 9\u20138 on penalties.[10] The season, under the returning Cardoso, ended with relegation after a 5\u20130 aggregate defeat to F.C. Arouca in the playoffs.[11]\n\nAfter relegation, Rio Ave signed 35-year-old manager Lu\u00eds Freire, who won promotion as champions in 2021\u201322 and was rewarded with a new contract.[12]\n\nIn 2023, Rio Ave's affiliated paying members (s\u00f3cios) approved the creation of a SAD and the entry of an investor, the Greek Evangelos Marinakis, who had already invested in Olympiacos and Nottingham Forest.[13][14]",

        "Description": "Boavista Futebol Clube,[a] commonly known as Boavista (Portuguese pronunciation: [bo\u0250\u02c8vi\u0283t\u0250]), is a Portuguese professional sports club from the Boavista neighborhood [pt] of Porto. Founded on 1 August 1903 by British entrepreneurs and Portuguese textile workers,[1] it is one of the oldest clubs in the country and plays in the Primeira Liga, Portuguese football's top flight.\n\nBoavista grew to become an important sports club in Portugal, with sections dedicated to several sports including football, chess, gymnastics, bicycle racing, futsal, volleyball, rink hockey and boxing, among others, with the most notable being the football section with their trademark chequered white and black shirts.\n\nWith 9 major domestic trophies won (1 Championship, 5 Portuguese Cups and 3 domestic Super Cups, all during the presidencies of Valentim Loureiro or Jo\u00e3o Loureiro, of the Loureiro family), Boavista is the most decorated Portuguese football club after the \"Big Three\" (Benfica, Porto and Sporting CP). Boavista spent 39 consecutive seasons in the Primeira Liga (50 in total) and, together with Belenenses, is the only team outside the \"Big Three\" to have won the Portuguese Championship, in the 2000\u201301 season. Boavista has a rivalry with fellow city club Porto;[2] the matches between the clubs are sometimes called O Derby da Invicta.\n\nIts stadium, Est\u00e1dio do Bessa, was built in 1973, although football has been played there at the former 'Campo do Bessa' since the 1910s, and was revamped for use in Euro 2004.",

        "Description": "Clube Desportivo Santa Clara is a Portuguese professional football club from Ponta Delgada, Azores. They play in the 13,277-seat Est\u00e1dio de S\u00e3o Miguel. As the most successful football team from the Azores Islands, they are the only team from the archipelago to compete in a UEFA competition, having qualified for the UEFA Intertoto Cup and the UEFA Europa Conference League.\n\nSanta Clara is the only club from the Azores to have competed in the top division of the Portuguese Liga, being thus the westernmost top-flight club in Europe. They compete in the Primeira Liga, the Portuguese first division football league. Santa Clara's kit manufacturer is Umbro and their main sponsor is Lebull. The main local rivals are CD Oper\u00e1rio from Lagoa on the same island of S\u00e3o Miguel. Other major rivals are C.S. Mar\u00edtimo and C.D. Nacional, from the island of Madeira.\n\nSanta Clara reached the Primeira Liga for the first time by coming third in the 1998\u201399 Liga de Honra, but were instantly relegated back in last place. The team bounced back by winning the 2000\u201301 Segunda Liga under Manuel Fernandes and later Carlos Manuel. Fernandes, who left for Sporting CP in January 2001, returned in October.[1]\n\nDespite coming 14th in their first top-flight season, Santa Clara were chosen by UEFA to play in the 2002 UEFA Intertoto Cup when Vit\u00f3ria S.C. withdrew, needing the summer to renovate their Est\u00e1dio D. Afonso Henriques for UEFA Euro 2004.[2] They beat Armenia's Shirak FC 5\u20133 on aggregate in the first round before falling 9\u20132 to Czechs FK Teplice in the second.[3] Santa Clara were relegated in 2003,[4] and then spent the next 15 years in the second tier, with the lowest point being 2014\u201315 when the club came 19th, saving themselves from relegation with three games remaining.[5]\n\nIn 2018, Carlos Pinto's Santa Clara team ended their exile by finishing second to C.D. Nacional, and he subsequently left.[6] His successor Jo\u00e3o Henriques led Santa Clara to two consecutive 10th-placed finishes, their best results for position and points (43) in their history. He left in July 2020, having secured a third consecutive top-flight season for the first time in club history.[7] Under his successor Daniel Ramos in 2020\u201321, the club finished a best-ever sixth to qualify for the inaugural UEFA Conference League.[8]\n\nSanta Clara defeated KF Shkupi (North Macedonia) and NK Olimpija Ljubljana (Slovenia) before falling to FK Partizan (Serbia) in the Conference League playoffs.[9] Ramos left unexpectedly in October 2021 with the team in 15th.[10] M\u00e1rio Silva concluded the season with the team in 7th, earning a two-year contract extension, as well as taking the team to the semi-finals of the Ta\u00e7a da Liga (at FC Porto's expense) for the first time.[11] Silva was sacked in January 2023 with the team 15th after as many games;[12] the form did not improve under successors Jorge Sim\u00e3o and Danildo Accioly and Santa Clara finished last, ending five years in the top flight.[13]",
